</div>
<p class='c006'>After the lapse of eight hundred years
the story of the crusades still furnishes the
most fascinating, if not the most instructive,
pages of Christian history. Romance
has entertained the generations from the
days of the Italian Tasso to those of Walter Scott with
the rude yet chivalric characters of those mediæval
times. Ponderous knights and dashing emirs, fair
women and saintly apparitions, continue to move over
the mimic stage of the imagination. Poetry, in all
the tongues of modern Europe, draws its imagery from
scenes that were enacted while these languages were
being formed from their classic or barbaric originals.
The hymnology of the church is enriched by the songs
of those who caught their rhythm from the march of
the crusading host. Bernard of Clugny watched the
salvation armies of the olden time as they sauntered
by his cloister window. Now catching their spirit,
and anon oppressed with their failure to express the
truest prowess of the believer’s soul, he tried to lift
men’s faith to the Jerusalem above:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O happy band of pilgrims,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>If onward ye will tread</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>With Jesus as your fellow</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To Jesus as your head!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thou hast no shore, fair ocean;</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Upon the Rock of Ages</div>

      <div class='line in2'>And thine the golden dower.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Our newest songs catch the very gleam of those battle
days. For example:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Onward, Christian soldiers,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Marching as to war,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the cross of Jesus</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Going on before!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>is not unlike the chorus of a Latin hymn of Berthier of
Orleans, which was sung under the tent and on the field:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">“Lignum crucis</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Sed præcessit</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">In vi Sancti Spiritus.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The student of human nature, also, will find here
his most subtle and perplexing, but at the same time
his most suggestive, subjects. Never before or since
was there such exalted faith combined with such
grotesque superstition, such splendid self-sacrifice
mingled with cruel and unrestrained selfishness, such
holy purpose with its wings entangled, torn, and besmeared
in vicious environments.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>To the historical scholar this period is unsurpassed
in importance by any, if we except the days of the
birth of Christianity. The age of the crusades covers
the eleventh and twelfth centuries. For two hundred
years, to use the vigorous language of the Greek
princess Anna Comnena, who witnessed the first
crusade, “Europe was loosened from its foundations
and hurled against Asia.” As an Alpine glacier presses
down into the valley, only to melt away at the summer
line, yet with renewed snows repeals the fatal experiment
from year to year, so seven times Western Christendom
replenished its mighty armaments, to see them
destroyed at the border-land of Oriental conquest.</p>

<p class='c007'>To define the causes of these vast movements is a
task which both tempts and tantalizes the historian.
It is surely unlearned to ascribe even the first crusade
to the sole influence of any man, though he were an
Urban <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> and wielded the temporal and spiritual authority
of the Papacy in its most puissant days. It
is puerile to say, as Michaud does, speaking of Peter
the Hermit, “The glory of delivering Jerusalem belongs
to a single pilgrim, possessed of no other power
than the influence of his character and genius.” It
is equally uncritical, if not blasphemous, to attribute
these most unfortunate and ill-timed ventures to the
Almighty, as the same writer does in these words:
“No power on earth could have produced such a
great revolution. It only belonged to Him whose
will gives birth to and disperses tempests to throw
all at once into human hearts that enthusiasm which
silenced all other passions and drew on the multitude
as if by an invisible power.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>To even approximate an understanding of this subject,
one must first become familiar with the great
racial movements which culminated in that age; must
be able to estimate the tendencies of society at a time
when it knew not the forces which were struggling
within itself; must penetrate the policies of statesmen
and ecclesiastics who veiled their ambition under the
self-delusion that they were serving God or their
fellow-men; and, besides all this, he must gauge the
passions and habits of common people, their ignorance
and superstition, if not the true heavenly ardor which
led them to offer themselves as fuel for the most
stupendous human sacrifice the world has known.
Were one thus equipped with information, one’s philosophical
judgment might still be baffled with the
inquiry, What was the chief cause of the crusades?
An observation of Dean Milman is especially applicable
to this subject: “When all the motives which
stir the human mind and heart, the most impulsive
passion and the profoundest policy, conspire together,
it is impossible to discover which is the dominant influence
in guiding to a certain course of action.” The
mighty tide of events we are to consider was not unlike
a vast river which sweeps through many lands
and has many tributary streams, some of whose
sources are hidden in the depth of the unexplored
wilderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our preliminary study will therefore be wisely
limited to an inquiry into the conditions of life and
thought in the eleventh century which facilitated or
prompted the great movement.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span><span class='sc'>These Conditions were Prominently</span>:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. The intellectual and moral state of society
in the eleventh century, especially its
rudeness and warlike spirit.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. The institution of chivalry, the awakening
of better ideals of heroism.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. The feudal system, which provided for
the easy mobilization of men in war or
adventure.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. The impoverished condition of Europe,
which forced enterprise to seek its reward
in foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. The papal policy to consolidate and universalize
the ecclesiastical empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. The menace of Mohammedanism under
the Saracenic and Turkish powers.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. The prevailing superstition, which credited
to pilgrimage the virtues of piety, and
substituted exploits in the Holy Land for
the plainer duties of holy life.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>Cardinal Baronius, the historian
of the church down to the year 1198,
designated the period which then closed
as the Dark Ages. The propriety of the
title has insured its perpetuity. The era
of the crusades is almost evenly divided by the date
which all scholars, following Baronius, regard as marking
the end of the worst and the beginning of better
times. The eleventh and twelfth centuries were the
battle-ground on which the grim spectres of the old
met the bright advancing spirits of the new civilization.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be remembered that the peoples then dominant
were the descendants of those barbaric hordes
whose irruption from northern Europe and western
Asia had swept away the Roman empire. The fierce
spirit of the Frank in Gaul, of the Goth in Spain, and
of the Lombard in Italy was not yet tempered by the
arts and philosophy their fathers had so nearly destroyed,
and whose renaissance had not yet begun.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>It was but a few generations since the people that
had inherited the Roman civilization had been largely
exterminated. So complete had been the ravage that
in the eighth century much of the land in Italy still
remained forest and marsh, a condition to which it
had reverted. Parcels of ground were purchased by
strangers as <i>eremi</i>, the title secured by the fact of
having cleared and cultivated any given spot. The
reader can readily paint his own picture of the society
which settled these lands by recalling such facts
as that from 900 to 930 Italy was under the Huns;
in 911 Normandy was conquered by Rollo the Dane;
in 1029 the Normans possessed themselves of the south
of Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Culture, however, was not entirely extinct. The
age produced many fine specimens of what is best in
manhood and womanhood, although, in comparison
with the general condition, these were like sporadic
bushes on the breast of a land-slide, whose roots have
maintained their hold through the rushing débris, or
which have sprung up afresh in the new soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were some men whose genius and virtues
would have adorned any age. Among these was
Gerbert, Pope Sylvester <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> (died 1003), whose attainments
in science led to the legend that he was in communication
with the devil. Lanfranc (1005-89), the
monk of Bec and Caen, whom William the Conqueror
appointed to the see of Canterbury, is still renowned
for his great logical ability and biblical scholarship.
Anselm (1033-1109) merited the praise which Dante
bestowed upon him as among the worthiest spirits he
saw in paradise. Bérenger (998-1088), though discredited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>for heresy, possessed a prowess and independence
of mind which made him the forerunner of the
later Reformers. Hildebrand (1020(?)-85), however
we may reprobate the hardness of his ambition and
the tyrannical nature of his projects, must be recognized
as among the greatest of mankind for astuteness
of judgment and ability to execute the most
gigantic and hazardous plans. Abélard (1079-1142)
was a lad of sixteen at the time of the first crusade,
but had begun to puzzle his teacher, William of Champeaux,
in his dialectical tilts, deriding the obsolete
method of inquiry, and declaring that it was more
sport to debate than to fight in a tournament. Bernard
of Clairvaux (1091-1153), whose pen was to
control Christendom for a generation, and whose
sainthood shines through all ages, was in the nursery
when the soldiers of the cross started for the East.
There were noble women, too. Bernard owed much
of his talent and virtue to his mother, Aletta, whose
memory is the imperishable ornament of womanhood.
The great Countess Matilda spoke many languages,
was chosen counsellor of Pope Gregory <abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr>, and won
her place in Dante’s catalogue of saints as the celestial
messenger heralding the chariot throne of the glorified
Beatrice. The praise of the great crusading captain
Godfrey halos his mother, Ida of Bouillon, to whom
he confessed that, next to the grace of God, he owed
whatever goodness made him beloved of men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The intellectuality of this period exercised itself almost
entirely with theological and religious subjects.
Men in seclusion elaborated and defended existing
church doctrines, and gave pious flight to their imaginations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>But of literature as such there was none;
even the Troubadours had not begun to rhyme the
Provençal tongue. The hot breath of the crusades
themselves forced the débris of the Latin to send out
its first flowers of poesy.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this age at least may be discerned the budding
of a taste and sentiment that betokened the refinement
of after times. Gothic architecture, the first efflorescence
of the Northern genius after it had been planted
in the soil of Southern art, now appeared in such
buildings as the cathedrals of Pisa, Modena, Parma,
Siena, Strasburg, Treves, Worms, Mayence, Basel,
Chartres, Brussels, and the foundation of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark’s
in Venice. The dreaded year 1000 having safely
passed without the anticipated destruction of the
world, faith reinspired art to build temples on earth.
New monasteries appeared, palatial in structure, to
accommodate the people who sought in seclusion
escape from the hardness or the dreariness of life in
the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must, however, be recognized that whatever brilliancy
of intelligence, beauty of character, or enterprise
appeared betokened a coming rather than illustrated
a passing age, like the wild flowers that shoot from the
cold ground in the early spring. To picture these
brighter things, were the genial task pursued to any
great extent, would endanger the accuracy of the impression
made upon the reader’s mind. Hallam truly
says of this period: “History which reflects only the
more prominent features of society cannot exhibit the
virtues that were scarcely able to struggle through
the general depravation.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>This was an age of gross ignorance. The art of
making paper from cotton had just been discovered,
and, while it contributed somewhat to the diffusion of
knowledge by giving cheaper manuscript books than
those on vellum, the world was to wait four centuries
longer for the printing-press to popularize the habit
of seeking information. The few manuscripts which
existed were the property of monasteries or of the
nobility, who kept them as articles of furniture rather
than for their practical use. We have a verbal monument
to the ignorance of these times in the expression
we still use when we speak of “signing,” or making
a mark to signify, one’s name. In the ninth century
Herbaud, the supreme judge of the empire, could not
write his name, and as late as the fourteenth century
Du Guesclin, high constable of France, was equally
innocent of letters. One of their contemporaries
gives this tribute to the ecclesiastics of the time:
“They were given rather to the gullet than to the
tongue (<span lang="la"><i>gulæ quam glossæ</i></span>). They preferred to be
schooled in salmon rather than in Solomon (<span lang="la"><i>salmone
quam Solomone</i></span>).” Few priests could translate the
breviary they recited with parrot tongues. Of the
history of the grand civilization just behind them
the people knew nothing; even the laws which had
so long preserved the state and society, those of Justinian,
were forgotten except in some cloisters, where
they were studied as classic lore.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practical methods of modern inquiry into the
meaning of the world, the incessant discovery of new
resources in nature for the comfort and luxury of living,
have stimulated and enlarged the human mind;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and in the new interests thus created men have found
a healthful diversion alike from the engrossments of
animalism and the morbid fancies of superstition.
But in the time we are studying there was no real
scientific thought that was not instantly suppressed
by the authorities of the church as the suggestion
of heretics or of the Saracens. Roger Bacon, who
flourished so late as the close of the crusades, paid
with fourteen years’ imprisonment for his temerity in
proposing the more rational methods of viewing the
world, which his great namesake, Francis Bacon, three
hundred and fifty years later, more completely formulated
for general acceptance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The industrial arts had been lost or had come to be
entirely neglected after the barbaric conquest which
swept away the Roman civilization, and during the
centuries since there had been scarcely any attempt
to revive them. The very faculty of invention seems
to have become paralyzed by disuse. It was not
until 1148 that Roger of Sicily established a silk factory
at Palermo, which, Hallam says, “gave the earliest
impulse to the industry of Italy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such times were necessarily marked by the narrow
limitation and degradation of common life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vast majority of people lived in the country,
in complete isolation from their fellows, seeking sustenance
in most primitive ways from the breast of
mother nature; or they were huddled together in rude
hamlets under the walls of the castles, whose lords enslaved
while they protected them; for such was the
chaotic condition of society that every one was compelled
to seek safety with service under some possessor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of a stronghold. Cities there were, crowded with
dense masses of humanity, the breeding-places of all
sorts of vice and social disorder. Towns owe their
existence to some community of interest, such as
similar industrial pursuits or convenience for trade;
these, of course, had scarcely begun to spring up.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the immediate environment of the common man
furnished no stimulus to enterprise, neither was it provided
by anything beyond his neighborhood. Without
a system of monetary exchange, trade was limited
to barter or to the purchasing power of purse and belt.
A brief journey with merchandise was executed with
hazard. Every petty lord exacted toll of those who
passed the border of his estate. Many of the occupants
of the castles lived by open robbery, and kept
men-at-arms, as they kept their falcons, to pounce
upon their prey. Not only the goods, the persons
also of travellers were regarded as legitimate booty,
the victims being held for ransom and often sold as
slaves. So enterprising were these robber knights
that it is said to have been dangerous for the king to
go from Paris to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>-Denis without an army at his
back. The armed merchantman rode generally with
lance in rest. In towns, says Thierry, “nobles, sword
in hand, committed robbery on the burghers, and
in turn the burghers committed violence upon the
peasants who came to buy or sell at the market of
the town.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was considerable foreign commerce on the
Mediterranean. The merchants of Pisa, Genoa, and
Venice were in rivalry with those of Byzantium, and
with the Saracens who held the ports of Spain and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>North Africa. But, as what are known as maritime
laws were not agreed upon until the thirteenth century,
commerce was little more than piracy. The
trade vessels were burdened with men for their defence,
or for rifling the cargoes of less puissant
marauders. The mariner’s compass had been invented,
but was not in common use, so that trade
was compelled to follow the coast-lines, in perpetual
hazard of wreck and robbers. There was no importation
of things for common use; the labor and danger
of transportation limited the articles of trade to those
of rarest value, which became the spoil of the powerful
or the purchase of the rich. The ordinary man
received no benefit from other neighborhoods than his
own, except that the air of heaven was sweetened by
its passage over the mountains and seas which separated
him from his kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is difficult for us to realize what must have been
the inane stupidity of the ordinary lives of men.
Homes were almost as dreary in their outward appointments
as the nests of eagles or the caves of
beasts. In the city were narrow apartments of stone
or the shanty with its mud-built walls, often as contracted
as the cells of the monastery and as damp and
fetid as the vaults of the prison; so that the monk lost
little of this world’s comfort in entering his religious
retreat, and the prisoner might think himself happy
at times in being better housed than he would have
been had he made his home with honest toil. If one
lived in the country the habitation was a hut but little
better than the shelter provided for cattle. Indeed,
in many cases the “ox knew his owner” from having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>slept on the same straw, and the “ass his master’s
crib” from its proximity to the family table. The
floor of the rude domicile was of earth or stone, the
windows unglazed, so that to exclude the winter
weather was to shut out the light also. A hole in the
roof scarcely sufficed to carry off the smoke from the
stoveless fires. No books entertained man’s thoughts,
no pictures pleased his eye; his news was the gossip
of oft-told tales, his faith such as a priest, himself unable
to read, might impose upon his less intelligent
parishioners. Even the peasant’s liberty of his own
solitude was denied him; he could not range the
woods nor float upon the streams at his pleasure.
We are told of certain instances where the rustics rebelled
against these restrictions imposed upon them.
“They took short cuts through the woods, or used
the fords and rivers at will;” but they were punished
by the knights, who “cut off the hands and feet of
the trespassers.” If the rich were better conditioned,
their residences were unfurnished with that which the
middle classes in our day regard as necessary to comfort
and decency. The bounty of the table was without
variety. Apparel, however gay, was such as
could be wrought by the women of the household.
The tapestries which excite our admiration were the
product of untold toil or purchased at vast expense.
Within the castle was spacious monotony, relieved
too generally by the grossness of private debauch;
without was the wilderness, threaded by roads that
were unfit for wheeled vehicles, menaced by wild
beasts and more dangerous men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The common recreation of the lordly classes was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>hunting and hawking, bear-baiting and fighting. Men
rode with sword and spear, the ubiquitous falcon on
arm, and hounds in leash. So universal were such
pastimes that, in lack of more intellectual and refined
resources, the highest dignitaries of the church displayed
the weapons of the chase together with the
insignia of their sacred office. So much of life was
wasted in these amusements that the Council of the
Lateran, in 1180, forbade the bishops indulging in
these sports while on their pastoral journeys. Previously
Pope Alexander <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> (1159-64), by special
edict, relieved the common clergy from the necessity
of keeping the archdeacons in hounds and falcons during
their visits to the churches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a limitation of the more generous and worthy
interests of mankind, which stimulate and enlarge the
mind, left the common intelligence in an almost infantile
condition. Sismondi says that even the nobles
came to count it a duty not to think. One can readily
believe this on recalling the titles given at court to
the various royal personages who graced it: Pepin the
Short, Charles the Bald, William the Red, Louis the
Fat, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fancy, however, will generally survive the failure
of the logical and æsthetic faculties, and thus men
become the easy prey of superstition. All sorts of
stories of things supernatural, the invention of designing
priests or born of the surprise of ignorance at the
unusual in nature, were believed without question.
The winds that rustled the leaves of the forest were
supposed to be the voices of saintly ghosts, and when
with wintry weight they moaned through the branches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>or screeched along the icy rocks, it was believed that
the damned were groaning in their pains or that demons
were threatening men. Every flash or shadow
that could not readily be explained was regarded as
a hopeful or vengeful apparition from the unseen
world. This credulity was not confined to the illiterate
and boorish. The chroniclers of that age, upon
whose learning we depend for the facts of our history,
relate with equal gravity the deeds of demons and men,
connect the doings of courts and the course of comets,
and intermingle in relation of cause and effect the
storms of nature and the wars of nations. Thus superstition
completed the work of mental inoccupancy, as
vermin and bats inhabit an unfurnished cell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a condition of the mental faculties could have
only a deleterious influence on the moral sense. We
are not, therefore, surprised to find the conscience of
the age correspondingly crude.</p>

<p class='c007'>This ethical degradation was reflected in the low
state of the laws, if the changeable wills or whims of
a host of petty lords can be dignified with the title of
legislation. Power claimed possession with little regard
for the method of acquisition. Disputes, when
relegated to the pretence of a court, were tried not
by weighing evidence, but by counting the number
of compurgators, that is, of those persons who would
swear that they believed the oath of one or the other
party. When the contestants were gentlemen or of
the noble order, the cases were arbitrated on the field
of Private Combat. Even the judge or referee of the
combat was himself liable to challenge from either
party that felt itself aggrieved by his decision. Priests,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>invalids, and women were accustomed to choose some
one from among their relatives or friends to champion
their cause. There was no appeal to candid judgment
after a full hearing of the facts, except in case of dispute
between slaves, villains, and freemen of inferior
condition, whose owners or lords might be disposed
to fair dealing. A relic of the mediæval custom of
private combat is the modern duel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The personal encounter often grew to the dimensions
of neighborhood war, in which kinsmen and retainers
were involved until entire districts were laid
waste. Neither the power of Charlemagne nor that
of the church prevailed against this unreasonable custom.
The one exception to this statement was the
temporary lull in the carnage during what was known
as the Truce of God, an expedient agreed upon in
certain places, according to which raids and riots were
confined to the half of the week succeeding the Sabbath.
But the adoption of this merciful rule forces
our attention to its necessity, since “man’s inhumanity
to man” was destroying entire populations as in a
deluge of blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>When for any reason the combat was inexpedient
the question of right was decided by the Ordeal.
The accused party presumed to walk through fire or
on burning ploughshares, to handle hot iron, float
upon water, plunge the bare arm into a boiling caldron,
or swallow a bit of consecrated bread with appeal to
Heaven to strike one dead if guilty. If one endured
the Ordeal unscathed he was said to be acquitted by
the judgment of God. It is not necessary to explain
the apparent impunity with which some of the worst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>criminals passed these trials, nor to cite the multitude
of cases in which persons of otherwise undoubted innocence
were adjudged guilty because they perished
in this irrelevant attempt to vindicate themselves.
The fact that questions involving the most sacred
rights of the individual, such as the holding of property,
the protection of the body from mutilation on
the rack, the retaining of life, and the vindication of
character, were not so much as brought to the court
of intelligence and conscience argues the degradation
of both these faculties.</p>

<p class='c007'>If further evidence be needed that the very sense
of justice had become largely extinguished, it is
found in the prevalence of judicial perjury, allowed,
and even prompted, by legalized custom. Before the
combat both parties were required to partake of the
sacrament, in which act one of the contestants, being
guilty, was forced to commit sacrilege. Witnesses
were sworn upon the relics of the saints; but, notwithstanding
these things were believed to have in them
a limitless power to help or hurt those who touched
their sacred incasements, the people seem to have
credited the righteousness of the dead as little as the
impartiality of the living, and the guilty were accustomed
to perjure themselves without dread of consequences.
The soul of good Robert of France was so
afflicted by the universal consciencelessness in this
respect that he devised an expedient for averting the
wrath of the saints, who might justly avenge the
slight put upon their bones. He ordered that the
relics should be secretly removed from the casket that
was supposed to contain them, so that the would-be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>perjurer might not actually commit the crime he intended.
If this act illustrated the mercy, it also displayed
the lack of true moral sentiment in him who,
in contrast with his fellows, was known as the “good
king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such stifling of the sense of justice was quite
naturally attended by the suppression of the gentler
emotions of kindness and humanity. This was an
age of almost incredible cruelty. Natural affection,
of course, survived in the love of parents and children,
husbands and wives. There were delightful friendships
which illumined the social gloom like threads of
gold in some dark fabric. Men and women lived and
died for one another, as they will always do while a
lineament of the divine remains in the human. But,
beyond the fascination of the individual and the obligations
of kinship, the sentiment of love seemed
unknown to the masses. The founders of the great
benevolent orders, men like Dominic and Francis of
Assisi, oppressed by this deadness to the essential
Christian spirit, were in the near future to unbind the
hearts of men that they might come forth to more
generous life; but that day had not yet come. Men
apparently had lost the sympathetic imagination by
which the pains and grief of the unfortunate are transferred
to the hearts of others. Dean Stanley remarks
of even the thirteenth century that “the age had no
sense of obligation to the poor and middle class.” It
was still needful that rulers should repeat the dying
counsel of Charlemagne to his sons, “not to deprive
widows and orphans of their remaining estates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This insensibility to the needs of others was accompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>by a positive gratification in scenes of cruelty.
The popular stories which mothers taught their children
were in praise of heroes whom we would regard
as butchers and bruisers. A favorite legend was of
Renoart, the flower of early Chivalry—he of the ugly
visage and gigantic frame, whose mace laid open the
brains of his antagonists, and who broke the skull of
the monk who refused to indulge his whim of exchanging
clothes with him. What child of that age
had not heard of Roland, the hero of Roncesvalles,
whose unstinted praises went far to form the manly
habits of many generations? He was an <i>enfant terrible</i>,
who tore his swaddling-clothes in pieces, belabored
his mother furiously, and gave early promise
of his prowess by beating lifeless the porter of the
castle who would not let him go out to play. And
how charming Roland’s love-making to the fair Aude!
He saw her for the first time amid the galaxy of beauties
assembled to witness his combat with Oliver.
Unable to restrain his passion, he rushed from the
lists, threw himself upon her, and would have carried
her off bodily had not Oliver given him one of those
blows the echo of which has rung the praises of this
mediæval prize-fighter down the ages.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the people of the eleventh century did not need
to go back to an earlier era for examples of this sort
of manliness. Foulques the Black, the greatest of
the counts of Anjou (987-1040), was pious enough to
go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but not sufficiently
humane to refrain from burning his young wife at the
stake, decked for her doom in her gayest attire. He
was so humble that he paraded the streets of the Holy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>City with a halter about his neck, while the blood
streamed from the scourge-wounds on his shoulders,
yet he forced his own son to be bridled and saddled
like an ass and to crouch on all fours at his feet. Of
the whole line of Anjou at this period the historian
Green remarks that “their shameless wickedness degraded
them below the level of man.” The house of
Normandy contested the palm of greatness with the
Angevins, but were equally rude. When William of
Normandy, afterwards the Conqueror of England,
learned that Baldwin of Flanders had refused him his
daughter Matilda in marriage, the chronicle says “he
forced his way into the countess’s chamber, found the
daughter, took her by her tresses, dragged her about
the room, and trampled her under his feet.” The
young lady does not seem to have been grieved by
the violence of the wooing, but rather to have acquired
a better appreciation of the lordly qualities of
her future husband. We may be permitted to doubt
the accuracy of this story, but the fact that it was so
early chronicled and generally believed attests the
popular taste. William Rufus (1056-1100) is thus
described by one who knew him: “The outrager of
humanity, of law, and of nature; beastly in his pleasures,
a murderer and blasphemous scoffer.” Henry <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr>
of England (1068-1135) put out the eyes of his
brother Robert and of his two grandchildren, and
forced his daughter to cross a frozen fosse, stripped
half naked.</p>

<p class='c007'>The penalties under law also revealed the hardness
of men’s hearts. Criminals were hung by their feet,
by their necks, or by their thumbs, with burning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>matter fastened upon some part of the body; they
were put into dungeons with snakes, and into cages
too small to allow the full motion of the limbs; they
were made to wear wooden or iron collars of enormous
weight, so arranged that the culprit could take
no position without feeling the burden.</p>

<p class='c007'>In battle the soldier was to despise the bow, his delight
to face the enemy at point of sword, his glory
the blood that bespattered him from the gurgling arteries
of the foe, or that trickled from his own wounds.
No Fabian policy gave éclat to the warrior; victory
was measured by the heaps of the slain, not by the progress
of the cause. No quarter was ordinarily given
or expected on the capture of strongholds; and not
infrequently the entire surviving population of conquered
cities paid with their lives the penalty for having
permitted themselves to be defended by the vanquished.
Raymond of Toulouse we shall learn to
admire as our story advances. He was one of the
most self-restrained and chivalric of the early crusaders;
yet he put out the eyes and cut off the noses of
his captives, and sent them thus mutilated to their
homes, as a warning to their neighbors not to molest
the march of the “soldiers of the cross.” Of this act
of atrocity the chronicler of the day remarks: “It is
not easy to do justice to the bravery and wisdom conspicuously
displayed by the count here.” Too commonly
the innocence of childhood, the venerableness
of age, and the sacredness of sex were indiscriminately
outraged by the license of conquest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The love of war for its own sake was the dominant
passion of such people. When no plausible pretext
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>could be urged for declaration of hostilities, it burst
out between neighborhoods as by spontaneous combustion.
Raids and counter-raids took the place of
the commercial rivalries of later times.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the days of Charlemagne it had been the custom
to signalize entrance upon manhood by buckling
about the loins the sword, the investment with “virile
arms.” The church, in hopeless inability to check the
universal passion for fight, sought only to direct it to
the suppression of ecclesiastical enemies. Pope Paschal
(1099) exhorted Count Robert of Flanders to
persecute to the utmost the Emperor Henry, saying,
“By such battles you shall obtain a place in the heavenly
Jerusalem.” Bernard, without dispute the holiest
man of the next century, offered no excuse or palliation
for his harangue to the faithful: “Let them kill
the enemy or die. To submit to die for Christ, or to
cause one of His enemies to die, is naught but glory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Very characteristic is the story of the death of the
youthful Vivien, as told in the famous “Chansons de
Geste,” composed about this time, though its alleged
events belong to an earlier date. Vivien was the
nephew of that William of Orange whose name is associated
with the rise of knighthood, as that of the
later William of Orange is with a nobler patriotism.
There had been a fearful fight. Vivien was mortally
wounded, and lay dying ere he had partaken of his
first sacrament. The older warrior bent over him
on the corpse-strewn field:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must confess to me, because I am your
nearest relative and there is no priest here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The failing lips of the lad began the confession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the sins of his brief lifetime. He could think of but
a single offence against God or his own nature; so
heinous was his conception of the greatness of this
one crime that it blotted out the memory of all else.
What was this monstrous iniquity?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I made a vow that I would never retreat one step
before an enemy, and this day I have failed to keep
my oath.”</p>

<p class='c007'>William raised the head of the dying boy, placed
the consecrated wafer, which he was accustomed to
carry for such emergencies, between the eager lips of
Vivien, and watched the young soul as, without fear
or misgiving, it went to the judgment of Him who is
preëminently the God of battles.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the wars of this period a common sight was that
of bishops and archbishops, clad in coats of mail, riding
through the streets of their episcopal towns on
fierce chargers, and returning to their palaces clotted
with dirt and blood. That was a deserved rebuke, as
well as a fine sarcasm, with which Richard Cœur de
Lion sent the blood-stained armor of the Bishop of
Beauvais to the Pope, as the garment of Joseph to
Jacob, asking the Holy Father if he recognized his
son’s coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even women on occasion put on armor and mingled
in the mêlée. Gaita, the wife of Robert Guiscard,
fought in the front rank of the Normans in their
conflict with the Greeks. When the crusades were
in progress many a fair woman adopted the martial
costume. The Amazonian Brunhilde is scarcely overdrawn
by Scott in “Count Robert of Paris,” and the
Moslem heroines of Tasso’s “Jerusalem Delivered,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>stripped of their supernatural resources, might have
figured in the Christian camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walter Scott put into the mouth of the Greek
Nicephorus a pertinent description of his fellow-Christians
of the West: “To whom the strife of
combat is as the breath of their nostrils, who, rather
than not be engaged in war, will do battle with their
nearest neighbors and challenge each other to mortal
fight, as much in sport as we would defy a comrade
to a chariot-race.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is but just to say that, if the Greeks were amazed
at the warlike propensities of the Catholics, they expressed
no wonder at their cruelty. In this they
themselves even excelled their more robust rivals.
The dungeons of Constantinople were filled with
political offenders whose eyes were torn from their
sockets; and more than one imperial candidate resumed
his place of honor among a people whose waving
banners he was unable to see. The Greek differed
from the Frank and German, the Norman and Saxon,
chiefly in being a coward and choosing to glut his
brutal instincts with the use of the secret torture, the
poisoned cup, or the dagger in the back of his victim,
rather than with the sword and battle-axe in open
fight.</p>

<p class='c007'>To a people such as we have described the appeal
for the crusades, in which the imagined cause of
heaven marched in step with their own tastes and
habits, was irresistible.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>
  <h3 id='chap03' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='three'>III.</abbr> <br> CHIVALRY—RULES—EDUCATION OF KNIGHT—CEREMONIES—INFLUENCE ON CHARACTER.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The call for the crusades, while appealing
powerfully to the warlike disposition of
the people, would not have succeeded in
rousing Europe had there not been in the
popular heart at least the germs of nobler
sentiment. The vitality of conscience notwithstanding
its degradation, and an inclination towards the
exercise of the finer graces of conduct in spite of the
prevalent grossness, manifested themselves in the rise
of Chivalry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The picturesqueness of knight-errantry, and the
glamour thrown over the subject by poetry and romance,
may mislead us as to the real character of this
institution. We must distinguish between the ideals
of knighthood and the actual lives of those who, from
various motives, thronged the profession. We must
not confound the Chivalry of these earlier and ruder
ages with that of its more refined, though somewhat
effeminate, later days. It would be an equal mistake
to pose the half-savage Saxon for a picture of the
gallant Provençal, because they were fellows of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>same order. But, making all allowance for variations,
defects, and perversions in Chivalry, the institution
went far towards redeeming the character of the middle
ages. Among the articles of the chivalric code
were the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>To fight for the faith of Christ. In illustration of
this part of his vow, the knight always stood with
bared head and unsheathed sword during the reading
of the lesson from the gospels in the church service.</p>

<p class='c007'>To serve faithfully prince and fatherland.</p>

<p class='c007'>To defend the weak, especially widow’s, orphans,
and damsels.</p>

<p class='c007'>To do nothing for greed, but everything for glory.</p>

<p class='c007'>To keep one’s word, even returning to prison or
death if, having been captured in fair fight, one had
promised to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Together with these vows of real virtue were others,
which signified more for the carnal pride of the warrior,
<abbr class='spell'>e.g.</abbr>:</p>

<p class='c007'>Never to fight in companies against one opponent.</p>

<p class='c007'>To wear but one sword, unless the enemy displayed
more than one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not to put off armor while upon an adventure,
except for a night’s rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Never to turn out of a straight road in order to
avoid danger from man, beast, or monster.</p>

<p class='c007'>Never to decline a challenge to equal combat, unless
compelled to do so by wounds, sickness, or other
equally reasonable hindrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The aspirant for knighthood began his career in
early boyhood by attending some superior as his
page. Lads of noblest families sought to be attached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>to the persons of those renowned in the order, though
not to their own fathers, lest their discipline should
be over-indulgent. Frequently knights of special
note for valor and skill at arms opened schools for the
training of youth. The page was expected to wait
upon his lord as a body-servant in the bedchamber,
the dining-hall, and, when consistent with his tender
years, upon the journey and in the camp. It was a
maxim of the code that one “should learn to obey
before attempting to govern.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With the development of manly strength, at about
his fourteenth year the page became an esquire. He
then burnished and repaired the armor of his chief,
broke his steeds, led his charger, and carried his
shield to the field of battle. In the mêlée he fought
by his master’s side, nursed him when wounded, and
valued his own life as naught when weighed against
his lord’s safety or honor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The faithful esquire was adubbed a knight at the
will and by the hand of his superior. This honor
was sometimes awarded on the field of conflict for a
specially valiant deed. More commonly the heroic
subalterns were summoned to receive the coveted
prize when the fight was done. More than one instance
is mentioned where the esquire bowed his head
beneath the dead hand of his master and there assumed
the duty of completing the enterprise in which
his chief had fallen. Ordinarily, however, the ceremony
was held in the castle hall, or in later times in
the church, on the occasion of some festival or upon
the candidate’s reaching the year of his majority.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rite of admission to knighthood was made as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>impressive as possible. The young man, having
come from the bath, was clothed in a white tunic,
expressive of the purity of his purpose; then in a
red robe, symbolical of the blood he was ready to
shed; and in a black coat, to remind him of the death
that might speedily be his portion. After fasting,
the candidate spent the night in prayer. In the
morning the priest administered to him the holy communion,
and blessed the sword which hung from his
neck. Attendant knights and ladies then clothed
him in his armor. Kneeling at the feet of the lord,
he received from him the accolade, three blows with
the flat of the sword upon his shoulder, with the
repetition of the formula, “In the name of God, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Michael, and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> George, I make thee a knight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>More impressive, because more unusual, was the
ceremony of his degradation, if he broke his plighted
faith or forfeited his honor. He was exposed on a
platform, stripped of his armor, which was broken to
pieces and thrown upon a dunghill. His shield was
dragged in the dirt by a cart-horse, his own charger’s
tail was cut off, while he was himself carried into a
church on a litter, and forced to listen to the burial
service, since he was now to move among men as one
who was dead to the honor for which he had vowed
to live.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief defect of Chivalry was that, while it displayed
some of the finer sentiments of the soul in
contrast with the general grossness of the age, it did
not aspire to the highest motives as these were felt
in the early days of Christianity and as they are
again apprehended in modern times. Notwithstanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the vow of devotion, there was little that was
altruistic about it. The thought of the devotee was
ultimately upon himself, his renown and glory. His
crested helmet, his gilded spurs, his horse in housing
of gold, and the scarlet silk which marked him as apart
from and above his fellows, were not promotive of
that humility and self-forgetfulness from which all
great moral actions spring. Our modern characterization
of the proud man is borrowed from the knight’s
leaving his palfrey and mounting his charger, or, as
it was called, getting “on his high horse.” In battle
the personality of the knight was not, as in the case
of the modern soldier, merged in the autonomy of
the brigade or squadron; he appeared singly against
a selected antagonist of equal rank with his own, so
that the field presented the appearance of a multitude
of private combats. In the lull of regular warfare he
sought solitary adventures for gaining renown, and
often challenged his companions in arms to contest
with him the palm of greater glory. Writers aptly
liken the mediæval knights to the heroic chiefs of
Arabia, and even of the American Indians, to whom
personal prowess is more than patriotism. Hallam
would choose as the finest representative of the chivalric
spirit the Greek Achilles, who could fight valiantly,
or sulk in his tent regardless of the cause, when
his individual honor or right seemed to be menaced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The association of Chivalry with gallantry, though
prompted by the benevolent motive of helping the
weak or paying homage to woman as the embodiment
of the pure and beautiful, did not always serve
these high purposes. The “love of God and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>ladies,” enjoined as a single duty, was often to the
detriment of the religious part of the obligation. The
fair one who was championed in the tournament was
apt to be sought beyond the lists. The poetry of the
Troubadours shows how the purest and most delicate
sentiment next to the religious, the love of man for
woman, became debauched by a custom which flaunted
amid the brutal scenes of the combat the name of her
whose glory is her modesty, and often made her virtue
the prize of the ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Doubtless the good knight felt that the altar of his
consecration was not high enough. Even his vow to
defend the faith had, within the bounds of Christendom,
little field where it could be honored by exploit
of arms. To take his part in the miserable quarrels
that were chronic between rival popes, or in the wars
of the imperial against the prelatic powers, both professedly
Christian, could not satisfy any really religious
desires he may have felt. The chivalric spirit
thus kindled the aspiration for an ideal which it could
not furnish. If the soldier of the cross must wear
armor, he would find no satisfaction unless he sheathed
his sword in the flesh of the Infidels, whose hordes
were gathering beyond the borders of Christendom.
The institution of Chivalry thus prepared the way for
the crusades, which afforded a field for all its physical
heroism, while at the same time these great movements
stimulated and gratified what to this superstitious
age was the deepest religious impulse.</p>

  <h2 id='chap04' class='c005'>CHAPTER <abbr title='four'>IV.</abbr> <br> THE FEUDAL SYSTEM—GENERAL PRINCIPLES—INFLUENCE ON PEOPLE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In accounting for the crusades we must
consider the governmental condition of
Europe at the time. Under no other
system than that of feudalism would it
have been possible to unify and mobilize
the masses for the great adventure. Had Europe
then been dominated by several great rulers, each
with a nation at his control, as the case has been in
subsequent times, even the popes would have been
unable to combine the various forces in any enterprise
that was not purely spiritual. Just to the extent in
which the separate nationalities have developed their
autonomy has the secular influence of the Roman see
been lessened. Kings and emperors, whenever they
have felt themselves strong enough to do so, have resented
the leadership of Rome in matters having temporal
bearings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor would the mutual jealousies of the rulers
themselves have allowed them to unite in any movement
for the common glory, since the most urgent
calls have never been sufficient to unite them even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>for the common defence, as is shown by the supineness
of Catholic Europe when, in the fifteenth century,
the Turks crossed the Marmora and assailed
Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the eleventh century there was no strong
national government in Europe; kingship and imperialism
existed rather in name than in such power as
we are accustomed to associate with the words. At
the opening of the tenth century France was parcelled
out into twenty-nine petty states, each controlled by
its feudal lord. Hugh Capet (987-996) succeeded in
temporarily combining under his sceptre these fragments
of Charlemagne’s estate; but his successors
were unable to perpetuate the common dominion.
In the year 1000 there were fifty-five great Frankish
lords who were independent of the nominal sovereign.
Indeed, some of these nobles exercised authority
more weighty than that of the throne. Louis <abbr title='the sixth'>VI.</abbr>
(1108) first succeeded in making his lordly vassals
respect his kingship, but his domain was small. “<span lang="fr">Île
de France</span>, properly so called, and a part of Orléannais,
pretty nearly the five departments of the Seine,
French Vexin, half the countship of Sens, and the
countship of Bourges—such was the whole of it. But
this limited state was as liable to agitation, and often
as troublous and toilsome to govern, as the very
greatest of modern states. It was full of petty lords,
almost sovereign in their own estates, and sufficiently
strong to struggle against their kingly suzerain, who
had, besides, all around his domains several neighbors
more powerful than himself in the extent and population
of their states” (Guizot).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>In Spain much of the land was still held by the
Moors. That which had been wrested from them
was divided among the Christian heroes who conquered
it, and who, though feudal rules were not
formally recognized, held it with an aristocratic pretension
commensurate with the leagues they shadowed
with their swords.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Germany, though imperialism had been established
firmly by Otho the Great, the throne was forced
to continual compromise with the ambition of its chief
vassals, like the dukes of Saxony, Bavaria, Swabia,
and Franconia. A papal appeal to such magnates
was sufficient at any time to paralyze, or at least to
neutralize, the imperial authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Norman holdings in the south of Italy, the
independence of the cities of Lombardy in the north,
the claims of the German emperor and of the popes
to landed control, were typical of the divisions of
that unhappy peninsula.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later than the age we are studying, Frederick
Barbarossa (1152-90) enjoined that “in every oath
of fealty to an inferior lord the vassal’s duty to the
emperor should be expressly reserved.” But it was
not so elsewhere. When Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> (1154-89) and
Richard <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr> (1189-99) claimed lands in France, their
French vassals never hesitated to adhere to these
English lords, nor “do they appear to have incurred
any blame on that account. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Louis (1226-70) declared
in his laws that if ‘justice be refused by the
king to one of his vassals, the vassal may summon his
own tenants, under penalty of forfeiting their fiefs, to
assist him in obtaining redress by arms’” (Hallam).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>The extent to which the French barons were independent
of the throne will be evident from a glance
at their privileges. They possessed unchallenged:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) The right of coining money. In Hugh Capet’s
time there were one hundred and fifty independent
mints in the realm.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) The right of waging private war. Every castle
was a fortress, always equipped as in a state of siege.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) Immunity from taxation. Except that the king
was provided with entertainment on his journeys, the
crown had no revenue beyond that coming from the
personal estates of its occupant.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) Freedom from all legislative control. Law-making
ceased with the capitularies of Carloman in
882. The first renewal of the attempt at general
legislation was not until the time of Louis <abbr title='the eighth'>VIII.</abbr> in
1223. Even <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Louis declared in his establishments
that the king could make no laws for the territories
of the barons without their consent.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) Exclusive right of original judicature.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if such was the independence of the feud-holder
in his relations to the sovereign, those beneath him
were in absolute dependence upon their lord. This
is seen in the following obligations of feudal tenants
to their superior:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) Reliefs: sums of money due from every one
coming of age and taking a fief by inheritance; fines
upon alienation or change of tenant ownership.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) Escheats: reversion to the lord of all property
upon a tenant’s dying without natural heirs, or upon
any delinquency of service.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) Aids: contributions levied in special emergency,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>as the lord’s expedition to the Holy Land, the marriage
of his sister, eldest son, or daughter, his paying
a “relief” to his overlord, making his son a knight,
or redeeming his own person from captivity.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) Wardship of tenant during minority. This involved
on the part of the lord the right to select a
husband for a female dependent, which alliance could
be declined only on payment of a fine equal to that
which any one desiring the woman could be induced
to offer for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the feudal system pressed so harshly upon those
who were themselves of high rank, it need not be
said that the common people were utterly crushed
by this accumulation of graded despotisms, whose
whole weight rested ultimately on the lowest stratum.
The mass of the lowly was divided into three orders:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) Freemen possessing small tracts of allodial land,
so called because held by original occupancy and not
yet merged in the larger holdings. There were many
freemen in the fifth and sixth centuries, but in the
tenth century nearly all the land of Europe had become
feudal. The freemen, whose possessions were
small, soon found it necessary to surrender land and
liberty for the sake of protection by some neighboring
lord.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) Villains or serfs, who were attached to the land
and transferable with it on change of owners.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) Slaves. The degradation of the servile class
was limitless, the master having the right of life and
death, entire use of the property and wages of his
people, and absolute disposal of them in marriage.
Slavery was abolished in France by Louis the Gross
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>(1108-37) so far as respected the inhabitants of cities;
but it took nearly two centuries more to accomplish
the abolition of servitude throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cities were, indeed, rising to assert their communal,
if not manhood, rights. The communes, as
they were called, demanded and received privilege
in certain places of electing any persons to membership
as citizens who were guaranteed absolute ownership
of property. But the communes were far from
even suggesting anything like the modern democratic
systems, and were opposed by clergy and nobility.
“So that,” says Guizot, “security could hardly be
purchased, save at the price of liberty. Liberty was
then so stormy and so fearful that people conceived,
if not a disgust for it, at any rate a horror of it.”
Men had not evolved the morality which could make
a commonwealth. Law was bound on men only by
force. The wall of the castle, grand and impressive
as wealth could build it, or only a rude addition to
the natural rock, was the sole earthly object of reverence.
To the strong man came the weak, saying,
“Let me be yours; protect me and I will fight for
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be evident that under the feudal system
patriotism, in the modern sense of attachment to one’s
national domain, can scarcely be said to have existed.
While we may not believe recent French writers who
assert that the love of their country as such was born
with the Revolution a hundred years ago, it is certain
that the mediæval attachment was no wider than to
one’s immediate neighborhood. The crusading Count
of Flanders, on viewing the desolate hills about Jerusalem,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>exclaimed, “I am astonished that Jesus Christ
could have lived in such a desert. I prefer my big
castle in my district of Arras.” The love of the
peasant seems to have been only for his familiar hills
and vineyards, and his loyalty was limited by the
protecting hand of his lord.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet generous spirits could not remain forever so
narrowly bounded in their interests. Men were ready
to hear the call to a wider range of sympathies and
actions. The summons for the crusades thus furnished
the lacking sentiment of patriotism; but it was a
patriotism that could not be bounded by the Rhine
or the Danube, by the Channel or the Pyrenees.
Europe was country; Christendom was fatherland.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time the compactness of each feud,
the close interdependence of lord and vassal, furnished
the condition for the organization of bands of fighting
men, ready to move at once, and to continue the
enterprise so long as the means of the superior should
hold out. There was needed to start the crusading
armies no council of parliament or alliance of nations,
hazarded and delayed by the variant policies of different
courts. If the baron was inclined to obey the
call of his ghostly superior, the successor of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter,
his retainers were ready to march. And the most
brawling of the barons was superstitious enough to
think that the voice of the Pope might be the voice
of God. If he did not, his retainers did, and disobedience
to the papal will might cost him the obedience
of those subject to him. Besides, many of the
feudal lords were themselves in clerical orders, with
their oath of fealty lying at the feet of the Holy Father.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Thus Europe, though divided into many factions,
and, indeed, because the factions were so many, was
in a condition to be readily united. We shall see in
a subsequent chapter that it was in the interest of the
holy see to apply the spring which should combine
and set in motion these various communities as but
parts of that gigantic piece of ecclesiastical and military
mechanism invented by Hildebrand.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h2 id='chap05' class='c005'>CHAPTER <abbr title='five'>V.</abbr> <br> THE IMPOVERISHED CONDITION OF EUROPE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The once luxuriant civilization of Rome
had been swept away by the Northern
invaders as completely as a freshet despoils
the fields when it not only destroys
standing vegetation, but carries with the
débris the soil itself. The most primitive arts, those
associated with agriculture, were forgotten, and the
rudiments of modern industries were not thought of.
Much of the once cultivated land had, as has elsewhere
been noted, reverted to native forest and
marsh, and in places was still being purchased by
strangers on titles secured by occupancy and first improvement,
as now in the new territories of America.
But even nature’s pity for man was outraged; the
bounty she gave from half-tilled acres was despoiled
by men themselves, as hungry children snatch the
morsels of charity from one another’s hands. What
was hoarded for personal possession became the spoil
of petty robbers, and what was left by the neighborhood
marauder was destroyed in the incessant
baronial strife. To these devouring forces must be
added the desolating wars between the papal and imperial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>powers, the conquest and reconquest of Spain
by Moors and Christians, and the despoiling of Saxon
England by the Normans. Throughout Europe, fields,
cottages, castles, oftentimes churches, were stripped
by the vandalism which had seemingly become a
racial disposition. To this ordinary impoverished
condition was added the especial misery, about 1195,
of several years’ failure of crops. Famine stalked
through France and middle Europe; villages were
depopulated. Cruel as they were, men grew weary
of raiding one another’s possessions when there was
nothing to bring back but wounds. Even hatred
palled when unsupported by envy and cupidity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crusades gave promise of opening a new world
to greed. The stories that were told of Eastern
riches grew, as repeated from tongue to tongue, until
fable seemed poor in comparison with what was believed
to be fact. All the wealth of antiquity was
presumed to be still stored in treasure-vaults, which
the magic key of the cross would unlock. The impoverished
baron might exchange his half-ruined
castle for some splendid estate beyond the Ægean,
and the vulgar crowd, if they did not find Jerusalem
paved with gold like the heavenly city, would assuredly
tread the veins of rich mines or rest among
the flowers of an earthly paradise. The Mohammedan’s
expectation of a sensual heaven after death
was matched by the Christian’s anticipation of what
awaited him while still in life.</p>

<p class='c007'>They who were uninfluenced by this prospect may
have seized the more warrantable hope of opening
profitable traffic with the Orient. The maritime cities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of Italy had for a long time harvested great gains in
the eastern Mediterranean, in spite of the Moslem
interruptions of commerce. Would not a tide of
wealth pour westward if only the swords of the
Christians could hew down its barriers?</p>

<p class='c007'>The church piously, but none the less shrewdly,
stimulated the sense of economy or greed by securing
exemption from taxation to all who should enlist, and
putting a corresponding burden of excise upon those
who remained at home, whose estates were assessed
to pay the expenses of the absent. The householder
who found it difficult to save his possessions while
keeping personal guard over them was assured that
all his family and effects would be under the watchful
protection of the church, with anathemas already
forged against any who should molest them. If one
were without means he might borrow to the limit of
his zeal, with exemption from interest. It was understood
that the Jews were still under necessity of
paying back the thirty pieces of silver with which
they had bought the Christians’ Lord, the interest on
which, compounded through the centuries, was now
equal in amount to all there might be in the vaults
of this accursed race.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we remember the wars of modern times
which have originated in the cupidity of men, we are
not surprised that the same disposition, inflamed by
the sense of dire need at home and the vision of
untold treasures <span lang="fr"><i>outre mer</i></span>, with heavenly rewards
beyond the sky, should have led to the same result
in an age that knew almost nothing of the arts of
peace.</p>

  <h2 id='chap06' class='c005'>CHAPTER <abbr title='six'>VI.</abbr>  <br> THE PAPAL POLICY—DEMORALIZATION OF THE WORLD AND THE CHURCH—HILDEBRAND’S PURPOSE INHERITED BY HIS SUCCESSORS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>We shall fail to appreciate the inception of
the crusades if we overlook the influence
of the papal policy in the middle ages.
These movements of Europe against Asia,
being under the direct patronage of the
popes, facilitated the plans of Rome to consolidate
and universalize the ecclesiastical empire. To understand
this policy we must recall the condition of
the church in its relation to popular life and the secular
powers.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have referred to the fact that the year 1000
had been looked forward to as that which should
mark the end of the world. So common was the
expectation of this termination of human affairs that
many charters, which have been preserved from this
period, begin with the words, “As the world is now
drawing to its close.” When, however, the fatal day
passed without any perceptible shock to the universe,
the popular credulity added the thirty-three years of
the life of our Lord to the calculation, and prolonged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the gruesome foreboding. But if the chronological
interpretation of the prophecy of the Book of Revelation
was a mistaken one, there was not wanting an
apparent fulfilment of the descriptive prediction,
“Satan shall be loosed out of his prison.” The falsity
and viciousness of men certainly took on fiendish
proportions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The worst feature of the general demoralization
was that the millennial fear had driven all sorts of
men into church orders. The priesthood and monasteries
were crowded with wretched characters,
whose imagined immunity in their sacred refuges
gave license to their carnal vices. The clergy were
no longer the shepherds, but the bell-wethers of the
wayward flock. Priests lived in open concubinage.
When Hildebrand, previous to his elevation to the
Papacy, took charge of the monastery of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul in
Rome, his first work was to drive out the cattle that
were stabled in the basilica, and the prostitutes who
served the tables of the monks. Courtesans reigned
even in the palaces of the popes with more effrontery
than in the courts of the secular princes. The offspring
of such creatures as the infamous Theodora,
and of her daughters Theodora and Marozia, had, in
the tenth century, purchased the tiara with their
vices. In those days the papal staff was wrenched
by violence from the hands that held it with more
frequency than the old Roman sceptre had been
stolen in the worst days of the empire. It may well
be credited that men began to pray again to pagan
deities in sheer despondency under the darkness
which veiled the Christian truth. The surviving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>religious sentiment was voiced in the solemn utterance
of the Council of Rheims, which declared that
the church was “ruled by monsters of iniquity, wanting
in all culture, whether sacred or profane.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If the tenth century closed with a gleam of hope
in the elevation of Gregory <abbr title='the fifth'>V.</abbr> (996-999) and Sylvester
<abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> (999-1003), it was quickly remembered
that the learning of the latter had been acquired
among the Saracens; and his biographer attributed
his attainments to magic and undue familiarity with
the fiends in hell.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the early part of the eleventh century the papal
chair was filled with the nominees of politicians, and
from 1033 to 1045 disgraced by Benedict <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr>, who
at the age of twelve was selected to pose as the Vicegerent
of God. The lowest vices and caprices of
unconscionable youth were enthroned in the place
that was most sacred in the thoughts of men. One
of his successors, Victor <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> (1086-87), said of Benedict
that he led a life so shameful, so foul and execrable,
that it made one shudder to describe it. A
man of such grovelling appetites naturally wearied
with even the slight usages of decency which had
come to be regarded as necessary in the papal palace;
and after twelve years of irksome attempt to support
its lessened dignity, he sold his tiara to Gregory <abbr title='the sixth'>VI.</abbr>
An unknown writer, about the middle of the eleventh
century, attempting a review of the passing age, exclaimed,
“Everything is degenerate and all is lost.
Faith has disappeared. The world has grown old
and must soon cease altogether.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the debasement of the church could go no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>lower, a reaction was natural and inevitable, if virtue
was not altogether decayed at the roots. The sentiment
of human decency reasserted itself, and, since
there was no power at Rome to inaugurate reform,
an appeal was made to the German emperor. Henry
<abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr>, in response to the call, deposed by force three
rival claimants to the papal throne, and secured the
ascendency of a line of German popes. It was not
without the suspicion of poison that two of them died
after brief power: Clement <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> within the year, and
Damasus <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> in twenty-three days.</p>

<p class='c007'>With Leo <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> (1049) came a better era. The
year 1033, the ultimate date set by the prophecy-mongers
for the end of the world, being clearly past,
and men becoming again possessed of hope in the
continuance of mundane affairs, the best spirits dared
to labor for the renovation of society, that the earth
thus saved as by fire might become indeed “a new
earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From this time the commanding genius and pure
purpose of Hildebrand guided, if he did not select,
the occupants of the seat of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter, until, in 1073,
the great counsellor himself assumed the sacred
sceptre. History, while it severely condemns the
methods by which Hildebrand sought to attain his
ends, credits him with rigid honesty and devotion to
what he believed to be the will of Heaven. While it
writes into his epitaph the charge of most inordinate
ambition, it does not erase from it the record of his
utterance as he lay dying, a fugitive at Salerno: “I
have loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore
I die in exile.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The religious degradation of Christendom afflicted
the soul of this truly great man; but whence could
come reform? The age was too far gone in its demoralization
to wait for recuperation through the slow
process of education. Society could not endure another
generation of its own putridity. The secular
powers were utterly impotent to cope with the gigantic
evils that were abroad in every land. Even
had they possessed the disposition to champion the
virtues, such sovereigns as the King of France, the
Emperor of Germany, the new Norman King of
England, were altogether engrossed in holding their
precarious crowns, surrounded as they were by a
multitude of feudal lords, some of whom could collect
in their own names a larger force than that which
would rise to defend the throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>To Hildebrand but one course seemed open, a
desperate one, whose hazard showed the audacity of
the genius that conceived it. It was nothing less than
to declare the Papacy a world monarchy, and to force
universal reform by the combined power of the secular
and spiritual sceptre held in his own hand. In his
bull against the Emperor Henry <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr> he used these
words: “Come now, I pray thee, O most holy
Father, and ye princes [<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul], that
all the world may know that if ye are able to bind
and loose in heaven, ye are able on earth to take
away, or to give to each according to his merits, empires,
kingdoms, duchies, marquisates, counties, and
the possessions of all men.... If ye judge in spiritual
affairs, how great must be your power in secular!
and if ye are to judge angels, who rule over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>proud princes, what may ye not do to these their servants!
Let kings, then, and all the princes of the world
learn what ye are and how great is your power, and
fear to treat with disrespect the mandates of the church.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To practicalize this enormous claim, the Pope made
two demands, which threw Europe into a state of
turmoil, (1) He ordered the renunciation of all investitures
of religious office by secular potentates.
The clergy held of the empire cities, duchies, entire
provinces, rights of levying taxes, coinage, etc.,
amounting to one half of all property. The sees thus
held Hildebrand declared to be vacated until their occupants
should again receive them from his hand under
pledge of absolute obedience to the papal, as opposed
to the imperial, authority. By this stroke the Pope
would gather to himself the practical control of all
countries. (2) Hildebrand forbade the marriage of
the clergy—a custom wide-spread at the time—and
commanded those who had entered into matrimony,
however innocently and legally, to forsake their wives,
as having been but concubines, and their children,
since logically they were but bastards. By enforcing
the celibacy of the clergy, he would have at his call an
army of men without domestic ties, care, or encumbrance,
and, so far as possible to human nature,
divested of individuality, and thus the pliant agents
of his single will.</p>

<p class='c007'>The audacity of Hildebrand’s scheme will be noted
by comparing it with the attitude of the most devoted
adherents to the papal authority previous to his time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The capitularies of Charlemagne contain many rules
for the regulation of religious duties. The emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>himself (794) presided at the Synod of Frankfort,
though a papal legate was in attendance. While he
brought the church all possible help as an ally, and
yielded to it all obedience as a private Christian, he
never allowed his imperial authority to be under so
much as the shadow of control by the papal. He
suffered but one religion in his domains, that which
had the Pope for its chief administrator; but he held
with equal strenuousness that the emperor was the
vicar of God in things temporal.</p>

<p class='c007'>From 964 to 1055 the popes had been the direct
nominees of the emperor. In 1059 the papal election
devolved for the first time upon the conclave of cardinals;
but the Lateran Council decreed that the
imperial confirmation must follow. Though in 1061
Alexander <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> was chosen without imperial sanction,
yet in 1073 Hildebrand himself, becoming Pope as
Gregory <abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr>, did not venture to discharge the duties
of the office without first asking and obtaining the
emperor’s assent.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this outward deference to the secular power
was only that he might grasp more securely the
weapon with which he would beat that power to
pieces. When the Emperor Henry <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr> resented the
sweeping claim of the Pope, Hildebrand launched
against him all the terrors of the pontifical throne.
His bull reads as follows: “Henry and all of his adherents
I excommunicate and bind in the fetters of
anathema; on the part of almighty God, I interdict
him from the government of all Germany and Italy;
I deprive him of all royal power and dignity; I prohibit
every Christian from rendering him obedience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>as king; I absolve all who have sworn or shall swear
allegiance to his sovereignty from their oaths.”</p>

<p class='c007'>(For the details of this controversy and the general
history of Hildebrand, the reader is referred to the
previous volume in this series, Vincent’s “Age of
Hildebrand.”)</p>

<p class='c007'>This policy of the Papacy to make itself the world
monarchy had a direct bearing upon the crusades
and facilitated the enterprise. The astute mind of
Hildebrand saw that a movement which should combine
the Catholics of all countries in Europe under
his command would immensely augment his prestige
as their great overlord. During his pontificate there
opportunely arrived at Rome messengers from the
Greek emperor at Constantinople, beseeching the aid
of Western Christendom in expelling the Turks, who
were menacing the capital of the East. Hildebrand,
consistently with his policy, prescribed as the condition
of such aid the recognition on the part of the
Greek Church of the headship of the Roman pontiff.
But in this demand he overshot the mark, while at the
same time the apathy of the Latin Christians towards
their Greek brethren, and his own controversy with
the German emperor, left him no opportunity to
launch the movement. It was left to Urban <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, his
second successor in the pontificate, to undertake the
great adventure. As Dean Milman remarks, “No
event could be more favorable or more opportune for
the advancement of the great papal object of ambition,
the acknowledged supremacy over Latin Christendom,
or for the elevation of Urban himself over the rival Pope
[Guibert] and the temporal sovereign, his enemies.”</p>

  <h2 id='chap07' class='c005'>CHAPTER <abbr title='seven'>VII.</abbr> <br> THE MOHAMMEDAN MENACE—THE RISE OF ISLAM—SARACENS—TURKS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The rapid rise and wide-spread conquest of
Mohammedanism make one of the most
startling phenomena of history. If its
story excites our wonder in these days,
while we are watching its decadence, we
may imagine the consternation wrought when its
swarming hosts, with the prestige of having conquered
all western Asia, were breaking through the barriers
of Christendom.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall greatly mistake this movement if we regard
it as a mere irruption of brute force such as
characterized the assaults of the barbarians upon the
Roman empire. The teachings of Mohammed, gross
as they appear in contrast with either primitive or
modern Christianity, contained elements which appealed
to far nobler sentiments than those entertained
by the pagans of northern Europe, or those current
in the age of the Prophet among the people of his
own race. Compared with these, Islamism was a
reformation, and enthused its adherents with the belief
that they fought for the advancement of civilization
as well as for the rewards of paradise.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The central thought of Islamism is the unity of the
Godhead, and its first victory was the obliteration of
polytheism among the tribes of Arabia.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that, before the time of Mohammed, Allah
had been accorded the first place in the speculative
theology of the Arabs; yet gods many usurped their
worship and were supposed to control their daily
lives. Wise men, called hanifs, had protested against
the prevailing superstition, and succeeded in spreading
a healthful scepticism regarding the lesser divinities.
Mohammed eagerly imbibed the better philosophy.
Familiarity with the religion of the Jews, and
some acquaintance with the doctrine of Jesus, whom
he accepted as a true prophet, doubtless gave shape
and vividness to his better faith. His meditations on
the grand themes of religion were, to his excited imagination,
rewarded by definite revelation. He rose
inspired with the conviction,—which became the call
for a new civilization in the Orient,—“Great is God,
and Mohammed is His prophet!” Islam, or resignation
to the sovereign will of Allah, became the title
and spirit of the new religion.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if a celestial ray had touched and stimulated
the mind of Mohammed, no heavenly influence refined
his heart and conscience. Sensuality and cruelty,
racial qualities of the Arab, were not only unrestrained,
but utilized as agencies for the spread of the faith.
Ferocity wielded the sword, and its fury was to be
rewarded by the gratification of lust in a paradise
whose description surpassed the sensuous fancies of
pagan poets and romancers. The spirit of the new
propaganda is evinced in this sentence from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Koran: “The sword is the key of heaven and hell;
a drop of blood shed in the cause of Allah, a night
spent in arms, is of more avail than two months of
fasting and prayer; whoever falls in battle, his sins
are forgiven, and at the day of judgment his limbs
shall be supplied with the wings of angels and cherubim.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It might seem that the Christian would be spared
the vengeance of Mohammed, since he also taught the
unity of the Godhead; but the Arabian misunderstood
Christianity. To him the Trinity was essential
polytheism. It must be confessed that such Christianity
as the Arab saw very naturally suggested that
false interpretation of the Bible doctrine. In some
Eastern Christian sects Mariolatry had exalted the
mother of Jesus to the third place in the Trinity, in
horrid usurpation of the office of the Holy Ghost.
The Koran expressly condemns the triform worship
of Jehovah, Jesus, and Mary. The Prophet, while
denying the divinity of Christ, regarded himself as
an avenger of Jesus, the holy man, against the heresy
of his professed followers. Mohammed’s last utterance
is reported to have been, “The Lord destroy
the Jews and Christians! Let His anger be kindled
against all those that turn the tombs of their prophets
into places of worship! Eternity in paradise!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only was the doctrine of the Koran acceptable
to the people to whom it was delivered; the organization
of the Mohammedan system provided an efficient
agency for its development and propagandism.</p>

<p class='c007'>This organization was exceedingly simple. It had
but one code for things religious and things secular.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>The Koran was at once the confession of faith and
the national constitution. From the same pages the
priest preached eternal life, caliph, emir, and sheik
quoted the rules of government, the judge drew his
decision in controversies, the soldier read his reward
for valor and death on the field, and merchant and
peasant found the regulations for their daily traffic.
The one book destroyed the distinction between sacred
and profane, since everything became thereby
religious, while the duties and amenities of common
life were surcharged with the bigotry of devoteeism.</p>

<p class='c007'>The unity of Moslemism under the book was
further intensified by the sole headship of the Prophet
and his successors. The fondest dream of the popes
of Rome, to blend spiritual and secular authority, was
surpassed by the throne which actually arose in the
Arabian desert. The opinion of the caliph was the
final decision of all questions of dogma; ministers of
state were his personal commissioners, and over them,
as over the humblest subject, he exercised the power
of life and death. One will was sovereign, responsible
to none other, and actuated all things in church
and state. One man’s word rallied tribes and sects,
and hurled them <i>en masse</i> upon his enemies, or in
more peaceful ways directed their seeming diversities
to the accomplishment of a single purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be acknowledged, however, that, while the
Mohammedan system thus adapted it to the most
deadly tyranny over thought and life, it was not
always so wielded. The cause was advanced by the
sagacity, if not the more humane inclinations, of
many of the caliphs. Not a few of these were among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the wisest men of their day, and adopted a policy of
leniency in dealing with their submissive enemies,
which facilitated the extension of their rule. The
repetition of a single sentence, acknowledging the
unity of God and the supremacy of the Prophet,
transformed foe into friend. In many instances the
tribute paid to the conqueror was far less than that
which the former Christian rulers had been in the
habit of exacting. Though, as a rule, Christian
churches were ruthlessly despoiled of their symbolic
ornaments and reduced to the barren simplicity of
the mosque, yet they were frequently spared this
sacrilege. When Jerusalem fell into the hands of
Omar, the Christians were forbidden to call to worship
by the sound of bell, to parade the streets in
religious procession, to distinguish their sect by badge
or dress, and were compelled to give up the temple
site for the mosque of Omar; yet they were allowed
freely to worship in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,
the caliph himself refusing to appear within those
sacred precincts, saying, “Had I done so, future
Mussulmans would infringe the treaty under cover of
imitating my example.” Haroun-al-Raschid, in exchanging
courtesies with Charlemagne, presented him
with the keys of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this compact unity of Mohammedanism under
Koran and caliph, and this wise blending of the terror
of arms with peaceful patronage, was due the
unparalleled progress of the religion of the Prophet.
The Moslem conquests will appear in the story, first
of the Saracen, and later that of the Turk.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Saracens.</i>—During Mohammed’s lifetime Arabia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and Syria were beneath his hand. Within eight
years following, Persia, parts of Asia Minor, Palestine,
and Egypt submitted to him. Thirteen years more
(653) saw the cimeter of the Saracens enclosing an area
as large as the Roman empire under the Cæsars. In
668 they assaulted Constantinople. In 707 North
Africa surrendered the treasures of its entire coast
from the Nile to the Atlantic, and the home of Augustine,
the father of Christian orthodoxy, was occupied
by the Infidels. In 711 the Saracen general
Tarik crossed the straits between the Mediterranean
and Atlantic, and landed on the rock which has ever
since borne his name—Jebel-Tarik, the “hill of
Tarik,” or Gibraltar. By 717 Spain, from the Mediterranean
to the Pyrenees, had become the proud
conquest of the Moors. But for the timely victory
of Charles Martel at Tours, in 732, they had surely
subdued France and soon completed the circle of
conquest by the desolation of Italy, Germany, and
the lands bordering the Balkans. In 847 the Saracens
were masters of Sicily, and besieged Rome itself,
plundering the suburban churches of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter and
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul. Thirty years later Pope John <abbr title='the eighth'>VIII.</abbr> wrote
to Charles the Bold: “If all the trees in the forests
were turned into tongues, they could not describe
the ravages of these impious pagans; the devout
people of God is destroyed by a continual slaughter;
he who escapes the fire and the sword is carried as
a captive into exile. Cities, castles, and villages are
utterly wasted and without an inhabitant. The
Hagarenes [sons of fornication and wrath] have
crossed the Tiber.” In 916 these persistent foes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>occupied a fortress on the Gangliano, between Naples
and Rome, whence they held the papal domain at
their mercy, and seizing the persons of pilgrims on
their way to the shrine of the apostles, held them for
heavy ransom. This stronghold was broken up only
by the attack of a powerful confederacy of Italian
dukes, aided by the emperors of the East and West.
The exigency was so great that, in the estimate of
papal apologists, it warranted the action of Pope
John <abbr title='the tenth'>X.</abbr>, who arrayed himself in carnal armor and
rode at the head of the attacking forces.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1016 a powerful armament of Saracens was
landed at Luna in the territory of Pisa, but defeated
by Pope Benedict <abbr title='the eighth'>VIII.</abbr> This disaster did not diminish
either the hauteur or expectancy of the invader,
who sent to the Pope a huge bag of chestnuts
with the message, “I will return with as many valiant
Saracens to the conquest of Italy.” The Pope was
not to be outdone in prowess of speech, and returned
a bag of millet with the boast, “As many brave warriors
as there are grains will appear at my bidding to
defend their native land.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1058 there occurred a wild outburst of Moslem
bigotry, which sent a thrill of horror through Christian
Europe. The charity of earlier rulers of Palestine
towards Christian worshippers gave place to fiercest
persecution by Mad Hakem, the Sultan of Egypt,
who razed to the ground the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, and slaughtered its devotees. He ultimately,
however, commuted his rage into cupidity,
and affixed a tax upon the worshippers. At the close
of the eleventh century, the time of the first crusade,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the Saracenic power, though steadily receding
before the Christians, still menaced southern Europe.
Trained bands of Moslems, when not in war on their
own account with their common enemy, the Christians,
joined themselves with one or another of the
contending parties which rent the empire and the
church. Thus in 1085, ten years before the first
crusade, Pope Gregory rescued Rome from the hands
of his imperial opponent, Henry of Germany, only
with the assistance of Saracen soldiers, who thronged
the ranks of the Pope’s Norman allies. Very naturally
the joy of the papal victory was mingled with
jealousy of the means by which it had been accomplished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only were Moslem warriors often found in
Christian ranks; frequently the valor of the Christian
knight found freest exploit in the cause of the Moors.
The adventures of the Cid, whom Philip <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> wished
Rome to canonize as an ideal saint, were for eight
years performed in the service of the Arab king of
Saragossa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moslem became also the rival of the Christian
in commerce. The ships which in the lull of hostilities
sailed from the ports of France and Italy met the
richly laden vessels of Egypt and Spain in exhausting
competition for the trade of the Mediterranean. The
coast of North Africa was the lurking-place of pirates,
who darted over the Great Sea with the celerity of
spiders along their web, and seized every craft that
weakness or misfortune made their prey. With his
wealth the Moslem often won his way to social position,
and even invaded the family relations of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Christian neighbor. Shakespeare’s Othello, the Moor
of Venice, if not a real character, was at least one
typical not only of the fifteenth, but of earlier centuries.
The plot of this play was borrowed by the
English dramatist from the Venetian romances. More
than one Desdemona had braved the curses of her
Christian kindred for the fascinations of the Infidel;
many a renegade Iago was found in his service; and
often the Christian dignitary, like Brabantis, was led by
gold and political advantage to assent that his daughter
should</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“run from her guardage to the sooty bosom”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>of the Moor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet these misalliances did not destroy the common
sentiment of the Christians against the Saracens. The
foul sensuality allowed by the Koran as it thus touched
the homes of Europe deepened the racial antipathy
of the people who were still monogamic in their faith
and customs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mohammedan menace was further augmented
in the superstitious notions of the age by the intellectual
ascendency of the Saracens. Christendom
did not discern that, in the mass of evils brought upon
Europe by the invasions from the East, there were
the germs of its own quickening, as the freshets of
the Nile enrich the land of Egypt. If, in the first
heat of his zealotry, the Saracen destroyed the library
of Alexandria, regarding the Koran as compensation
for all the books of Christian and pagan wisdom, yet
in the light of the flames he saw his mistake, and became
the most liberal patron of education. To the
mosque he added the school. While the rest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Europe was in the density of the Dark Ages, the
Moorish universities of Spain were the beacons of the
revival of learning. The Christian teacher was still
manipulating the bones of the saints when the Arab
physician was making a <span lang="la"><i>materia medica</i></span> and practising
surgery. By the discovery of strong acids the
Moor laid the basis of the science of chemistry; by
the adoption of the Hindu numerals he improved
arithmetic. He first practically used, if he did not
invent, algebra; introduced astronomy to the European
student; wrote on optics, the weight and height
of the atmosphere, gravity, capillary attraction; applied
the pendulum to the measurement of time, and
guessed that the earth was round. In the superstition
of Christian Europe these studies were regarded,
if not as belonging to the magic arts, at least as
threatening the faith by fostering undue independence
of thought, and tempting to scepticism regarding the
office of the church as universal teacher. The subsequent
persecution of Galileo and Bruno was anticipated
in the hatred and fear which were awakened
by such names as Ben-Musa (ninth century), Avicenna
(tenth century), Alhazan and Algazzali (eleventh
century). The diverse spirits of the age are illustrated
by the Giralda, the tower of Seville, which
was built by the Moors for an observatory, but on
the Catholic conquest was used only for a belfry.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Turks.</i>—The Saracenic conquests caused only a
part of the Mohammedan menace in the eleventh century.
A new power appeared, which has since dominated
the middle Orient. For generations the Turks,
or Tartars, had been steadily pressing southward and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>westward, from Turkestan and the borders of China
towards the fertile plains and rich cities of the eastern
Roman empire. Of nomadic habits, their entire
property was in their camps and the driven herds
that sustained them. They were skilled horsemen,
cradled in the saddle, tireless on the march, loving
the swift foray better than luxurious residence, inured
to danger, and careless of blood. In the course of
their migrations they came in contact with the followers
of Mohammed. The Koran, with its celestial
indorsement of sensuality, easily captivated in such
a people that demand of common human nature for
some religious faith and pursuit. They became the
most enthusiastic devotees of the new faith, although
in their deeper passion for selfish conquest they often
slaughtered their fellow-religionists of other races.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in the eleventh century one division of this
people—the Seljukian Turks, so named from their
great chieftain, Seljuk—overran Armenia and conquered
Persia. Togrul-Beg, the grandson of Seljuk,
had been elected to the chieftaincy according to the
ancient custom, the chance drawing, by the hand of
a child, of an arrow inscribed with his name. He was
further honored by being chosen a temporal vicar of
the caliph of Bagdad, then the chief of Arabic Mohammedanism.
In 1055 Togrul-Beg was proclaimed
“Commander of the Faithful and Protector of Mussulmans.”
He was clothed in the seven robes of
honor, was presented with seven slaves born in the
seven climates of Araby the Blest, was crowned with
two crowns and girded with two cimeters, emblematic
of dominion over both the West and the East.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>The successor of Togrul-Beg was Alp-Arslan, the
“strong lion” (1063). He merited his title when, like
a wild beast, he ravaged Armenia and Iberia, and
then sprang upon Asia Minor. At the time, this
peninsula between the Mediterranean and the Euxine
was flourishing with proud cities and prolific fields,
and occupied by an industrious, peace-loving population.
The ruined amphitheatre and aqueduct which
to-day oppress the curiosity of the traveller are the
footprints of this Turkish invader, which the misgovernment
of his successors has not permitted to be
effaced. In the battle of Manzikert (1071) Alp-Arslan
defeated and captured Romanus <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr>, the
Greek emperor, and thus broke the only Eastern
power that could dispute his sway. Finlay remarks:
“History records few periods in which so large a
portion of the human race was in so short a time reduced
from an industrious and flourishing condition
to degradation and serfage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Under Malek-Shah, son of Alp-Arslan (1073), the
Turkish power, swollen by new hordes from the great
central plains of Asia, occupied almost the entire territory
now known as Turkey in Asia. They pressed
to the walls of Constantinople. By threatening, and
by intrigue with every insurgent against the throne,
they kept the Greek empire in constant alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>In their peril the Greeks appealed for help to their
Christian brethren of Europe. In spite of the scorn
in which the Latins held the Greek Church for its
antipapal heresies, the common danger led Pope
Gregory <abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr> (Hildebrand) in 1074 to summon all
Christian potentates to repel the Turks. He himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>proposed to lead the avenging hosts, but was diverted
from this generous purpose by the nearer ambition of
crushing the enemies of the papal throne at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1079 the Emperor Michael saved his crown
only by the assistance of the Turks against his Greek
rival, for which aid he paid by surrendering to Solyman
the government of the best part of the empire
east of the Bosporus.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1093 Europe was startled by the news of the fall
of Jerusalem. After incredible slaughter, not only of
Christians, but of Arabic Moslems as well, the black flag
of Ortuk floated from the tower of David. All privileges
which had been granted to followers of Jesus by
the comparative humanity of the Arab were now withdrawn
by the Turk. To bow in worship at the Holy
Sepulchre was to bend the neck beneath the cimeter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Europe was thrown into a state of terrorism. Moslem
irruption into the West seemed imminent. Kings
trembled on their thrones, and peasant mothers hushed
their crying babes with stories which transformed
every spectre into the shape of the turbaned invader.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1093, on the death of Malek-Shah, the Turkish
power was weakened by divisions; this gave Christendom
heart. The statesmen at the Vatican saw the
opportunity, and Pope Urban’s appeal for the crusades
met the quick response both of the powers and
the people. One of the divisions of Malek-Shah’s
empire was that of Solyman, Sultan of Roum, or
Iconium. From this power sprang the Ottomans,
who for eight hundred years have held an unbroken
dynasty, and for four hundred years have occupied
the city of Constantine for their capital.</p>

  <h2 id='chap08' class='c005'>CHAPTER <abbr title='eight'>VIII.</abbr> <br> PILGRIMAGES—ORIGIN AND GROWTH OF THE CUSTOM—EXTENT.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Old Testament religion made much of sacred
places. In the early occupancy of
Palestine, Hebron, Bethel, Shiloh, and
Shechem were the resorts of the faithful;
in later ages Jerusalem became the shrine
“whither the tribes went up” by divine command.
For this localized devotion there was an evident reason
in the purpose of Providence to localize a “peculiar
people” for religious training, such as they could not
obtain if scattered among the nations. The sacredness
was not in the site, but in its living associations,
as the rendezvous of wise and holy men. Christianity
had no such necessity, and reversed this narrower
policy with our Lord’s command, “Go ye into all
the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”
Therefore, in the ruling of Providence, the places
most closely associated with the life of the Son of
God were either unknown, as the spot of the temptation
in the wilderness and the mountain where He retired
for prayer; or these spots were left unmarked by
the first disciples, as “a high mountain” on which He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>was transfigured, the room of the Last Supper, the site
of the crucifixion and of the tomb which witnessed
His resurrection. This was a commentary of Providence
on Jesus’ words, “The hour cometh, when ye
shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,
worship the Father; ... when the true worshippers
shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This relic of the Jewish custom, together with the
universal pagan practice of venerating shrines and
consulting local oracles, became an ever-pressing
temptation to the early Christian church. It was
difficult for either Jewish or heathen converts not to
regard the land trodden by the feet of Jesus as peculiarly
a holy land, and not to imagine that the celestial
interest that once centred upon the scenes of His
death and resurrection made “heaven always to hang
lowest” over these spots. There was nothing in the
teaching or practice of the apostles and early fathers
of the church to suggest or approve these notions.
They were willing exiles from the home of the faith;
unlike the patriarch Joseph, they gave no “commandment
concerning their bones” being interred in the
dust of Palestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conversion of Constantine to Christianity may
have been genuine, but it did not completely exorcise
the paganism to which he had been habituated. The
pilgrimage of his mother, Helena, to Palestine, the
alleged reidentification of sacred sites and relics by
miraculous agencies, and their adornment with lavish
magnificence, were the natural efflorescence of the
hybrid religion that sprang up. Multitudes imitated
the example of emperors and princes in the show of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>devotion. The new glory which Constantine gave
to Jerusalem engaged their reverence, as his new
capital on the Bosporus gratified their pride.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Jerome (345-420) wrote to Paulinus: “The
court of heaven is as open in Britain as at Jerusalem.”
Nevertheless the saint took up his abode in the Church
of the Nativity at Bethlehem. Paula, his companion,
wrote: “Here the foremost of the world are gathered
together.” <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine (354-430), oppressed by
the fact that the beauty of the heavenly city was shadowed
by men’s reverence for the earthly Jerusalem,
wrote: “Take no thought for long voyages; it is not
by ship, but by love, that we go to Him who is everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the enthusiasm for pilgrimage could be checked
neither by the voice of saint nor by common sense.
From the depths of the German forests, from the
banks of the Seine and the bleak shores of Britain, as
well as from the cities of southern Europe, poured
the incessant streams of humanity, to bathe in the
waters of the Jordan where their Lord was baptized,
or perchance to die at the tomb which witnessed his
resurrection.</p>

<p class='c007'>As early as the fourth century itineraries were
published to guide the feet of the pious across the
countries of Europe and Asia Minor; hospitals were
also established along the road, the support of which
by those who stayed at home was regarded as specially
meritorious in the sight of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 611 Chosroes the Persian and Zoroastrian captured
Jerusalem, slaughtered ninety thousand Christian
residents and pilgrims, and, more lamentable in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the estimate of that age, carried off the wood of the
true cross. But Heraclius, the Greek emperor, after
a ten years’ war triumphed over the Persian power.
Neither conquered lands nor the spoils of princely
tents compared in stirring enthusiasm with the recapture
of this relic. With great pomp the emperor left a
part of the cross to glorify his capital, Constantinople.
On September 14, 629, Heraclius entered Jerusalem,
bearing, like Simon the Cyrenian, the remainder of
the sacred beams upon his back. With bare feet and
in ragged garments he traversed the city and re-erected
the symbol of the world’s faith upon the
assumed site of Calvary. This event is still commemorated
throughout the Roman Catholic world by
the annual festival of the “exaltation of the holy
cross.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Marvellous stories, the innocent exaggerations of
weak minds or the designed invention of less conscionable
shrewdness, fed the credulity of the people.
Bishop Arculf told of having seen the three tabernacles
still standing upon the Mount of Transfiguration.
Bernard of Brittany as an eye-witness described
the angel who came from heaven each Easter morn
to light the lamp above the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the opening of the ninth century the friendship
of Haroun-al-Raschid, King of Persia, for Charlemagne
extended the privileges of pilgrims. The
keys of the sepulchre of Jesus were sent by him as
a royal gift to the Emperor of the West. Charlemagne’s
capitularies contain references to “alms sent
to Jerusalem to repair the churches of God,” and to
provide lodging, with fire and water, to pilgrims <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>The cruel persecution by Mad Hakem, the caliph
of Egypt (see <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 57), made scarcely an eddy in the
current of humanity moving eastward. Counts and
dukes vied with prelates in the multitude of their
companions. In 1054 the Bishop of Cambray started
with a band of three thousand fellow-pilgrims. In
1064 the Archbishop of Mayence followed with ten
thousand, nearly half of whom perished by the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the latter part of the eleventh century, as has
been related, the strong hand of the Turk first effectually
checked the pilgrims. The horrors of the
atrocities perpetrated by this new Mohammedan
power afflicted Europe less than the cessation of the
popular movement. The evil was twofold, secular
and spiritual.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pilgrimage was often a lucrative business as well
as a pious performance. In the intervals of his visits
to the sacred places the European sojourner plied his
calling as a tradesman; the Franks held a market before
the Church of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mary; the Venetians, Genoese,
and Pisans had stores in Jerusalem and the coast
cities of Phenicia. The courtiers of Europe dressed
in the rich stuffs sent from Asia, and drank the wine
of Gaza. A great traffic was done in relics. The
pilgrim returned having in his wallet the credited
bones of martyrs, bits of stone from sacred sites,
splinters from furniture and shreds of garments made
holy by association with the saints. These were sold
to the wealthy and to churches, and their value augmented
from year to year by reason of the fables
which grew about them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In more generous minds the passion for pilgrimage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>was fed by the desire for increased knowledge. Travel
was the only compensation for the lack of books. One
became measurably learned by visiting, while going
to and returning from Palestine, such cities as Constantinople
or Alexandria, to say nothing of the enlightening
intercourse with one’s fellow-Europeans
while passing through their lands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mere love of change and adventure also led many
to take the staff. If in our advanced civilization men
cannot entirely divest themselves of the nomadic
habit, but tramp and tourist are everywhere, we need
not be surprised at the numbers of those who indulged
this passion in days when home life was exceedingly
monotonous and its entertainment as meagre.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the chief incentive to pilgrimage was doubtless
the supposed merit of treading the very footprints of
our Lord. Not only was forgiveness of sins secured
by kneeling on the site of Calvary, but to die <i>en route</i>
was to fall in the open gateway of heaven, one’s
travel-soiled shirt becoming a shroud which would
honor the hands of angels convoying the redeemed
soul to the blissful abodes. Great criminals thus
penanced their crimes. Frotmonde, the murderer,
his brow marked with ashes and his clothes cut after
the fashion of a winding-sheet, tramped the streets of
Jerusalem, the desert of Arabia, and homeward along
the North African coast, only to be commanded by
Pope Benedict <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> to repeat his penance on even a
larger scale, after which he was received as a saint.
Foulques of Anjou, who had brought his brother to
death in a dungeon, found that three such journeys
were necessary to wear away the guilt-mark from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>conscience. Robert of Normandy, the father of William
the Conqueror, as penance for crime walked barefoot
the entire distance, accompanied by many knights
and barons. When Cencius assaulted Pope Hildebrand,
the pontiff uttered these words: “Thy injuries
against myself I freely pardon. Thy sins against
God, against His mother, His apostles, and His whole
church, must be expiated. Go on a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We are thus prepared to appreciate the incentive
to the crusades which men of all classes found in the
speech of Pope Urban at Clermont, in inaugurating
the movement: “Take ye, then, the road to Jerusalem
for the remission of sins, and depart assured of the
imperishable glory which awaits you in the kingdom
of heaven.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Othman, the founder of the Ottoman dynasty of
Turks, once had a dream in which he saw all the
leaves of the world-shading tree shaped like cimeters
and turning their points towards Constantinople. This
he interpreted into a prophecy and command for the
capture of that city. Similarly we may conceive the
various conditions and sentiments of Europe in the
eleventh century, which have been described in our
previous chapters, as directing the way to Jerusalem.
Subsequent events, however, prove that, unlike Othman’s
leaves, the Christian incentives to the crusades
were not directed by the breath of Heaven.</p>

<h3 id='chap09' class='c008'>CHAPTER <abbr title='nine'>IX.</abbr> <br> THE SUMMONS—PETER THE HERMIT—POPE URBAN—POPULAR EXCITEMENT.</h3>
<p class='c006'>It has been customary to attribute the
actual initiation of the crusades to the
fiery eloquence of Peter the Hermit.
This man was a native of Picardy, and
was possessed of a spirit as restless as the
seas that washed the shores of that northern province
of France. He at one time seems to have followed
the life of a soldier, but his ardent mind demanded
higher entertainment than the gossip of camps and
exploits of the field. The pursuit of letters, in an age
so barren of literary resources, soon wearied him.
Ecclesiastical duties seemed also a dreary routine.
Like many of the nobler spirits of his day, he deserted
the world and in the seclusion of his own thoughts
sought communion with Heaven. His mind, unfurnished
with information of the actual world, filled itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>with visions. From ecstatic solitude he emerged at
times to sway the masses with the eloquence of a
second John the Baptist. According to tradition, he
made the pilgrimage to Palestine, the sight of whose
holy places inflamed his spiritual zeal, while the
atrocities perpetrated upon his fellow-Christians by
the Turks rent his heart. Together with Simeon, the
venerable Patriarch of Jerusalem, he wept over the
desolation of Zion. He there conceived the sublime
purpose of rousing all Europe to take up arms against
the common enemy. One day, while praying before
the Holy Sepulchre, he heard the voice of Christ
saying, “Peter, arise! hasten to proclaim the tribulations
of My people.” Bearing a letter from the
patriarch, he went to Rome and summoned Pope
Urban <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, as the Vicegerent of Jesus, to listen to this
new evangel from the ascended Lord. Urban perceived
in the monk’s fervor the signs of the will of
Heaven, and commissioned him to proclaim it to the
nations of Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is unfortunate for the romance of this part of
Peter’s life that it is unconfirmed by any contemporary
records. Anna Comnena, the Greek annalist,
who lived in Peter’s day, declares that, while he started
upon the pilgrimage, he did not reach Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is best to regard Peter’s career as having been
inspired by the crusading project already determined
upon by others. His eloquence was like the first rush
of steam from a newly opened volcano; it could not
have generated the mighty force that upheaved
Europe and “hurled it against Asia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But there can be no doubt of the personality of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Peter, and of his tremendous influence in exciting the
populace to engage in the crusades after they were
decreed in the councils of Rome. His labors in the
great cause seem to have been limited to certain districts
of France, for it is scarcely credible that a man
of strange language could have thrown the spell of
his rhapsodies over people living beyond the Rhine.
Peter the Hermit was of small stature, with long beard
prematurely whitened by the rigors of his life,—for
he was not yet fifty years of age,—with deep and
penetrating eyes, fired by the enthusiasm that filled
his soul. He travelled from place to place with uncovered
head and bare feet, mounted upon a mule.
The churches proving too small, the people thronged
about him in the market-places and fields, where
they drank from his lips wrath for the Moslem, pity
for the Christian martyrs, whose blood he painted as
flowing in the streets of Jerusalem, and hope of eternal
reward if they should take the cross and sword.
In the frenzy of speaking he wept, wounded his own
flesh with the violence of his gesticulation, and exhausted
his physical strength in the rhapsody of
speech, as he called upon the saints in heaven and
the inanimate rock of Calvary to cry out against the
apathy of the Christian world. The people were
readily persuaded, and attributed the response of
their own passion, already inflamed by alarming
events, to the preacher’s miraculous gifts. They
pressed about him that they might receive some
heavenly grace from touching his person, and preserved
as sacred relics the hairs they pulled from the
tail of his mule.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Very opportunely there arrived at Rome in the
year 1095 an embassy from Alexius, the Greek emperor
at Constantinople, begging assistance against
the Turks, who were threatening the shores of the
Bosporus. In his fright, or in the disingenuous
diplomacy for which the Greeks were noted, Alexius
offered to reward the Western warriors with the treasure
of his capital, and even suggested that the empire
they saved from the Mussulman might one day
become the prize of the Latin. Urban summoned a
synod at Piacenza, where the Greek messengers addressed
in the open fields the crowd of ecclesiastics
and laymen, which was so vast that neither the plazas
nor churches of the city could contain them.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second council, more imposing on account of the
dignitaries present, was held at Clermont in November
of the same year. In his speech Urban wrought
the assembly to a fury of enthusiasm as he cried,
“Exterminate this vile race [Turks and Arabs] from
the land ruled by our brethren.... It is Christ who
commands.... If any lose your lives on the journey
by land or sea or in fighting against the heathen,
their sins shall be remitted in that hour. This I grant
through the power of God vested in me.... Let
those who have hitherto been robbers now become
soldiers. Let those who have formerly been mercenaries
at low wages now gain eternal rewards. Let
those who have been exhausting themselves to the
detriment both of body and soul now strive for a twofold
reward, on earth and in heaven.” This impassioned
appeal was answered by the cry of bishop and
lord and knight, and was reëchoed by the assembled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>populace, “Deus vult! Deus vult!” (“God wills
it!”) “Deus vult! let that be your watch-cry,” responded
the pontiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>All ranks and conditions of men thronged to receive
the cross, if possible from the hands of the Holy
Father himself. This was a strip of red cloth given
with the assuring words, “Wear it upon your shoulders
and your breasts; it will be either the surety of
victory or the palm of martyrdom.” All priests
throughout Europe were authorized to give the
sacred symbol, with the full papal benediction, to the
people in their parishes. Many, in their infatuation,
burned the cross-mark into their quivering flesh;
others, grown insane through zealotry, imagined the
stigmata—as these signs were called—to have been
produced by miraculous process. An impostor was
readily credited with having received the mark on his
forehead by the hand of an angel, and confessed the
fraud, but not until after he had been invested with
the archbishopric of Cæsarea in Palestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Preachers of the holy war went everywhere. Over
western Europe the enthusiasm passed like a forest
fire. During the winter of 1095 there seemed to be
but one occupation of men in palace, monastery, and
cottage throughout northern France and along the
Lower Rhine—that of preparing arms and enrolling
bands for the mighty exodus, which should take place
as soon as the roads became passable in the spring.
The rich sold or mortgaged their estates to raise the
means of fitting out themselves and their retainers.
Knights and esquires drilled incessantly for feats of
arms against a foe whom they honored for his rumored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>prowess in fight as much as they detested him for
impiety. Recluses left their religious retreats, their
minds overwrought with anticipations of miracles to be
performed as in old Bible days, when waters divided
and city walls fell down at the approach of God’s people.
Robbers emerged from their hiding-places or
were delivered from jails, that they might expiate the
crimes already committed against their fellow-Christians
by atrocities to be practised upon the unbeliever.
Doubtless many were influenced by a genuine religious
emotion, as the proclamation of the crusade was
accompanied by the preaching of the “terrors of the
Lord” against the prevalent sins of the people. To
the persuasion of Peter the Hermit many of the most
notorious sinners attributed their reformation. Young
men who were inclined to the monastic habit to escape
the temptations of the world were easily led to
substitute the helmet for the cowl, as offering a life
more congenial to youthful enterprise and at the
same time more acceptable to God. Multitudes of
the ignorant were animated by the new and popular
enthusiasm without understanding its motive, and
were drawn as by a freshet into the common channel.
That no one might be deterred by domestic anxieties
from engaging in the crusades, the church guaranteed
the protection of the families and property of absentees;
and that no one might be tempted, in the
subsidence of the first fervor, to reconsider his purpose,
excommunication was threatened on those who did
not fulfil their vows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus western Europe in the spring of 1096 was not
unlike a beehive, on the outside of which the insects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>are gathered preparatory to swarming. Guibert, a
contemporary, says: “Although the French alone had
heard the preaching of the crusade, what Christian
people did not supply soldiers as well?... You
might have seen the Scotch [who represented to the
continental mind the ends of the earth], covered
with shaggy cloaks, hasten from the heart of their
marshes.... I take God to witness that there
landed in our ports barbarians from nations I wist not
of; no one understood their tongues, but placing their
fingers in the form of a cross, they made sign that
they desired to proceed to the defence of the Christian
faith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The flight of these swarms of humanity eastward
had three consecutive features which should be noted.
First, it was a crusade of the crowd, which began in
March, 1096; secondly came the more orderly military
movement, under the great feudal chieftains,
which began in the subsequent autumn; and thirdly,
the enterprise became consolidated on national lines,
under the kings, who gradually acquired power and
took command of their various peoples. This last
feature, however, did not appear until the second
crusade, nearly half a century later.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE FIRST CRUSADE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='chap10' class='c008'>CHAPTER <abbr title='ten'>X.</abbr> <br> THE CRUSADE OF THE CROWD.</h3>
<p class='c006'>The eloquence of Peter served him in the
stead of more orderly methods of enlisting
the people. Untrained masses of men,
women, and children followed him from
place to place, and about Easter to the
number of upward of sixty thousand crossed the
Rhine. Walter, surnamed the Penniless, assumed
the leadership of the advance portion of this impatient
throng. The people, however, cared little for any
authority save that of the imagined divine presence,
which would appear through pillars of cloud and
fire to direct them in emergency. The fears of the
more cautious were silenced by a saying of Solomon,
“The grasshoppers have no king, yet they go
forth in companies.” A goose and a goat were led at
the head of the motley procession, under the fanatical
delusion that in these creatures resided some super-human
wisdom. It has been suggested that this
superstition was due to the importation of Manichean
notions, since the goose was the Egyptian symbol for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>the divine sonship, and the goat represented the
devil—the opposing principles of good and evil as
conceived by this Eastern sect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first vengeance of the marching crowd was inflicted
upon the Jews, whose historic infidelity excited
the wrath, or whose accumulated wealth tempted the
cupidity, of the ill-provided host. In the cities of
what is now western Germany this unfortunate people
were pillaged and massacred to such an extent that,
says Gibbon, “they had felt no more bloody stroke
since the persecution of Hadrian.” The crusaders’
appetite for plunder thus whetted, they passed on to
the ruder countries of Hungary and Bulgaria, where
they took a forceful revenge upon a people of kindred
Christian faith for refusing to supply them with provisions.
This provoked a bloody retaliation, under
which the advanced crusaders were scattered, more
than two thirds of their number perishing in the defiles
of the Thracian mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>Peter, who had delayed at Cologne, with a new
German contingent followed the desolate track of his
forerunners. He propitiated Coloman, the Hungarian
king; but at Semlin, enraged at the marks of the discomfiture
of Walter, he looted the town. At Nisch his
army abused the hospitality of the Bulgarian prince,
Nichita, who had given them the freedom of the market.
The outraged people took terrible vengeance,
and Peter’s host was driven out. At length, in sorry
remnants, they reached Constantinople August (30,
1096). With the permission of the Emperor Alexius,
they pitched their camp outside the city gates to
wait for the new bands of crusaders.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>A third horde pressed upon the footsteps of Walter
and Peter, led by Gottschalk, a German priest. Reaching
Hungary in the midst of the late summer harvest,
they forgot their religious vows in the abundance
which surrounded them, and gave themselves up to
every form of debauchery. King Coloman lulled the
invaders into a feeling of security until, taking advantage
of a time when they were unarmed, he gave
orders for their extirpation. This was not difficult to
accomplish, as the followers of Gottschalk were of a
lower class than even those who had preceded them,
largely vagabonds and brigands, ferocious only in
crime, and without the spirit of noble and sustained
adventure.</p>

<p class='c007'>A still more unconscionable crowd had in the meantime
gathered on the banks of the Rhine and Moselle.
A bigoted priest, Volkman, and a reprobate count,
Emico, were chosen leaders. These men hoped to
atone for the crimes of youth by excesses of cruelty
wrought under the name of religion. This band met
with terrible chastisement from the Hungarians at
Merseburg. The walls of the town, which they had
undermined, gave way under their assault and buried
multitudes of the assailants in the falling débris. In
the words of William of Tyre, the panegyrist of the
later crusades, “God Himself spread terror through
their ranks to punish their crimes and to fulfil the
words of the Wise Man, ‘The wicked flee when no
man pursueth.’” Through Bulgaria their advance
was of the nature of flight to gain the sheltering
walls of Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here, about the Greek capital, were collected the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>wrecks of various expeditions. If the memory of
their misfortunes, augmented by their different stories
of the journey, depressed and solemnized the crusaders,
idleness and the sight of the riches of Constantinople
inflamed their natural thirst for spoil.
Homes and even churches in the suburbs were looted.
The Emperor Alexius induced his unwelcome guests
to cross the Bosporus into Nicomedia, where for two
months he supplied their wants, as men feed wild
beasts that they may not themselves fall prey to their
rapacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The impetuosity of the crusaders was soon stirred
again by their proximity to the Turks. They refortified
the deserted fortress of Exerogorgo; but scarcely
were they within its walls when Kilidge-Arslan (“sword
of the lion”), the Sultan of Roum, laid siege to and
captured the place. He then surprised the town of
Civitat, outside of which the crusaders had made their
chief camp. A terrible massacre ensued. Out of a
numberless multitude, but three thousand remained
to contemplate, instead of proud cities they had hoped
to wrest from the Infidel, the piles of bones which
strewed the plains of Nicæa. Walter was slain, and
the town into which the miserable remnant was
huddled would have fallen into the hands of the
Turks but for the opportune relief afforded by the
imperial troops from Constantinople. It is estimated
by Gibbon that not less than three hundred thousand
lives were lost in these preliminary excursions before
the more orderly hosts started from western Europe.</p>
<div>

  <h3 id='chap11' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='eleven'>XI.</abbr> <br> THE CRUSADE UNDER THE CHIEFTAINS, GODFREY, RAYMOND, BOHEMOND, TANCRED, HUGH, ROBERT OF NORMANDY.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The age, though degenerate, had nourished
an order of men of far loftier type than
those we have described. Godfrey of
Bouillon was the most prominent figure.
The chivalric spirit of the middle ages enrolled
him among the nine greatest heroes of mankind—Joshua,
David, Judas Maccabæus, Hector,
Alexander, Cæsar, Arthur, Charlemagne, and Godfrey.
He was of noblest lineage. His father was
brother-in-law to Edward the Confessor of England,
and through his mother, the beautiful and saintly Ida
of Lorraine, he inherited the blood of Charlemagne.
He was short of stature, but of such prodigious
strength that he is reputed to have divided an opponent
from helmet to saddle with one blow of his sword.
He was equally endowed with courage and sagacity.
In his war against the rival emperor, Rudolph, Henry
<abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr> committed the imperial standard to Godfrey, who,
though but a youth of eighteen, honored this charge
by penetrating to the presence of Rudolph in the
thick of the battle, plunging the spear of the standard
through his heart, and bearing it aloft with the blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of victory. Yet such a deed in that age did not lessen
his repute for gentleness and piety. Two ancestral
spirits alternated their control of him, if we are to
credit the praise given him by an old chronicle of the
time: “For zeal in war, behold his father; for serving
God, behold his mother.” When Rome was besieged
by his imperial patron, Godfrey signalized his prowess
by being the first to mount the walls. This exploit,
however, troubled his tender conscience as a devout
Catholic, and when the crusade was proclaimed he
sold his lands and devoted himself to the holy war,
in attempted expiation of what he had come to regard
as his former impious deeds. At the head of ten
thousand horse and seventy thousand foot, he set out
for the Holy Land. He was accompanied by his two
brothers, Baldwin and Eustace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Raymond of Toulouse led a second army composed
of the men of Languedoc. He was the most opulent
and haughty of the chieftains, as well as the most experienced
in years and war. He had fought by the
side of the Cid in Spain, and was haloed in popular
estimate with some of the glory of that great knight.
Alfonso <abbr title='the sixth'>VI.</abbr> of Castile had not hesitated to bestow
upon him his daughter Elvira, who shared with her
husband the hazard of the expedition. One hundred
thousand warriors followed in Raymond’s train as he
took the cross. With him went Bishop Adhemar of Puy,
the papal legate, who, in the name of the Holy Father,
was the spiritual head of the combined expeditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bohemond of Taranto marshalled another host.
He was son of the famous Robert Guiscard, founder
of the Norman kingdom of Naples. Anna Comnena
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>thus describes him: “He was taller than the tallest
by a cubit. There was an agreeability in his appearance,
but the agreeability was destroyed by terror.
There was something not human in that stature and
look of his. His smile seemed to me alive with
threat.” The fair annalist recognized Bohemond’s
inheritance of his great father’s prestige and ability,
and at the same time of his disposition “to regard as
foes all whose dominions and riches he coveted; and
was not restrained by fear of God, by man’s opinions,
or by his own oaths.” Robert Guiscard had died
while preparing for an attempt to capture Constantinople.
With filial pride, his son Bohemond had also
“sworn eternal enmity to the Greek emperors. He
smiled at the idea of traversing their empire at the
head of an army, and, full of confidence in his fortunes,
he hoped to make for himself a kingdom before
arriving at Jerusalem.” When the march of the other
crusaders was reported to him, with an ostentation of
piety which his subsequent career scarcely justified,
Bohemond tore his own elegant mantle into tiny
crosses and distributed them to his soldiers, who were
at the time engaged in the less glorious attempt of
reducing the Christian town of Amalfi.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tancred de Hauteville by his splendid character
amply compensated the defects of Bohemond, his
kinsman. In history and romance he is celebrated
as the type of the perfect soldier:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“Than whom</div>
      <div class='line in2'>... is no nobler knight,</div>
      <div class='line'>More mild in manner, fair in manly bloom,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or more sublimely daring in the fight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Dissatisfied with even the ideals of Chivalry, Tancred
hailed the new lustre that might be given to arms
when wielded only in the cause of justice, mercy, and
faith, which, perhaps too sanguinely, he foresaw in
the crusade. Thus nobly seconded by Tancred, Bohemond
took the field with one hundred thousand horse
and twenty thousand foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hugh of Vermandois, brother of Philip <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr> of France,
led the host of Langue d’Oil, as Raymond that of
Languedoc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert of Normandy, son of William the Conqueror,
set out with nearly all his nobles. To raise
money for the expedition, he mortgaged his duchy
to his brother, William Rufus of England, for ten
thousand silver marks, a sum which that impious
monarch raised by stripping the churches of their
plate and taxing their clergy. Robert was companioned
by Stephen of Blois, whose castles were “as
many as the days of the year,” and by Robert of
Flanders, “the lance and sword of the Christians.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These leaders, deterred by the difficulty of obtaining
sustenance for such multitudes as followed them,
agreed to take separate routes, which should converge
at Constantinople. Count Hugh was the first afield.
He crossed the Adriatic, and after much beating by
tempest gathered his men at Durazzo. Here he experienced
what his comrades were continually to meet,
the treachery of the Greek emperor, Alexius. Being
the brother of the French king, Hugh would be a
valuable possession of the Greeks, as hostage for the
good behavior of his brethren. By Alexius’s order he
was seized and sent without his army to Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Godfrey’s band took the road through Hungary,
already marked by the bones of the crusaders under
Peter and Walter. The ghastly warnings everywhere
about him encouraged him to treat with justice and
kindness his coreligionists through whose lands he
was journeying. He enforced strict military discipline
against pillage, and appeased the wrath of the Hungarians
by leaving his brother Baldwin in their hands
as hostage for his good faith. But beneath the
gentleness of Godfrey smouldered fiery indignation
against all forms of injustice. When, therefore, he
heard of the capture of Count Hugh he demanded of
the emperor instant reparation, failing to receive
which, he took summary revenge by laying waste the
country about Adrianople. The emperor reluctantly
pledged the release of Count Hugh. When the
crusaders camped before Constantinople, Alexius
refused to sell them provisions except on condition
of their rendering homage to his throne. Several
leaders had in their extremity yielded this point, but
Godfrey replied by letting loose his soldiers to gather
as they might; this brought Alexius to better terms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bohemond and Tancred crossed the sea to Durazzo
and thence took the route eastward through Macedonia
and Thrace. Hearing of the duplicity of
Alexius, Bohemond urged Godfrey to seize upon
Constantinople. Though Godfrey declined to divert
his sword from the Infidels, the rumor of Bohemond’s
proposal led the haughty Greek to seek closer alliance
with his unwelcome guests. With stately parade, he
adopted Godfrey as a son, and, in return for the formal
bending of the knee at his throne, intrusted to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the defence of the empire. When Bohemond reached
the Eastern court he was received with flattering
protestations of friendship, which he repaid with equal
adulation and as unblushing deceit. These two men
at least understood each other, perhaps by that subtle
instinct which leads serpents of a kind to come
together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Count Raymond had greater difficulties in leading
his forces from northern Italy around the head of the
Adriatic and over the mountains of Dalmatia, whose
semi-savage inhabitants menaced his march. From
Durazzo, he says, “right and left did the emperor’s
Turks and Comans, his Pincenati and Bulgarians, lie
in wait for us; and this though in his letters he spoke
to us of peace and brotherhood.” The stern warrior
inflicted cruel retaliation upon his assailants by cutting
off the noses and ears of those he captured. On
arriving at Constantinople, the irate veteran proposed
to his brother chieftains to immediately sack the city.
But, in spite of his severity, the blunt honesty of Raymond
eventually won from Alexius more praise than
did the apparent compliance of his brethren; for, says
Anna Comnena, “My father knew that he [Raymond]
preferred honor and truth above all things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The expedition of Robert of Normandy gave no
credit to the crusading zeal. That chief, surnamed
“Short-hose” and “the Fat,” chose the route through
Italy, and justified his repute for indolence by spending
the entire winter in that genial climate. Robert
of Flanders and a few resolute kindred spirits shamed
the lethargy of their brethren, and crossed the Adriatic
in spite of wintry storms. Many others, disgusted with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the general conduct of affairs, returned to their homes.
It was not until after Easter in 1097 that Duke Robert
and Count Stephen embarked at Brindisi.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these armies were encumbered by the presence
of women and children, since the crusading scheme
proposed not only war against the Mussulman, but
settlement in the lands that should be conquered. In
some cases the entire population of villages and sections
of cities tramped eastward, so that the movement
took the character of a migration rather than
that of a campaign.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dealings of the Greek emperor with the crusaders
were characteristic of the man. Alexius Comnenus
had secured the throne in 1081 by successful
rebellion and the capture through treachery of the
capital, which he gave over to license and rapine.
His subsequent policy as a ruler was in keeping with
its beginning. The intrigues by which he acquired
power were matched by the despotic cruelty with
which he held it. His career has been depicted for
us by the partial pen of his daughter Anna. Through
her fulsome coloring we can detect the contemptible
disposition of Alexius, and in her unblushing admissions,
while purposing only to praise, we can also see
much of the prevailing degeneracy of the Greek mind
and conscience. Sir Walter Scott would temper our
contempt for the man by the consideration that “if
Alexius commonly employed cunning and dissimulation
instead of wisdom, and perfidy instead of courage,
his expedients were the disgrace of the age rather
than his own.” But his wife, the Empress Irene,
without doubt correctly summarized his personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>character when, watching by his death-bed, she exclaimed,
“You die as you have lived, a hypocrite.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No doubt Alexius had reason to fear the proximity
of the crusaders. In the strong figure of Gibbon, he
was like the Hindu shepherd who prayed for water.
Heaven turned the Ganges into his grounds and
swept away his flocks and cottage in the inundation.
Alexius was aware of the ambition of Bohemond to
harm the Greek empire, and suspected all his comrades
of similar designs. The rude manners of the
invaders were also such as not to ingratiate them
with the sycophancy of the court. Once, while the
Franks were paying homage to the emperor, one of
them unceremoniously placed himself beside his
Majesty, remarking, “It is shocking that this jackanapes
should be seated, while so many noble captains
are standing yonder.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alexius was doubtless right in exacting from his
visitors an oath of loyalty while within his dominions,
and a pledge to turn over to him any Greek cities and
fortresses they might recapture from the Turks. This
was agreed to by all except Count Raymond, who
declared that he would have no oath but to Christ,
and invited the emperor to share with the crusaders
the marches and battles against the Turks if he would
divide the spoil. The ambition and cupidity of Bohemond
were stayed with bribes. Thus Alexius one
day introduced the Norman leader into a roomful of
treasures. “Ah, here is wherewith to conquer kingdoms!”
exclaimed Bohemond. The next day the
treasures were transferred to his tent. The amazing
request of Bohemond to be appointed Grand Domestic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>or general of the Greek empire, was declined by Alexius,
who had himself held that office and found it a
convenient step to the throne. He, however, promised
Bohemond the rule of the principality of Antioch
in the event of his conquering it with his sword.
Tancred, with a delicate sense of honor that shamed
the truculency of his kinsman, fled the imperial lures
by avoiding the city and keeping himself in disguise
on the Asiatic side of the Bosporus. His example
was not lost upon his fellow-chieftains, who felt the
enervating influence of the daily vision of palaces,
villas, gorgeous equipages, and, as the historian has
fondly noted, the beauty of the women of the capital.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alexius encouraged the virtuous purpose of the
Latins to resume the crusade, from considerations of
their menace to his own domain while encamped
within it. With apparent magnanimity, he facilitated
their crossing the Bosporus, and applauded the heroism
of their start through the plains of Bithynia. In
every way he fanned their enthusiasm against the
Turk; but at the same time he informed the enemy
of the movement of his allies, that their victories
might not diminish his own prestige, and that, in the
event of their discomfiture, he might profit by the
friendship of the Infidel.</p>

  <h3 id='chap12' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twelve'>XII.</abbr> <br> THE FALL OF NICÆA.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The first objective chosen by the crusaders
was Nicæa, a city sacred with the memories
of the first great ecumenical council
of the Christian church, in the time of
Constantine. On their march the soldiers
of the cross were saddened by the continual sight of
the decayed bodies of those who had fallen in the ill-advised
expedition of Peter and Walter. A few survivors
of this calamity, in rags and semi-starvation,
came from their hiding-places to welcome their brethren.
Among them was the Hermit himself. His tale
of woe sharpened their zeal and encouraged their
caution against the skill and bravery of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Infidels were under the command of Kilidge-Arslan,
Sultan of Roum, still flushed with his slaughter
of the first crusaders. He had fortified Nicæa, and
had gathered within and about its walls sixty thousand
men, drawn from all the provinces of Asia Minor and
from distant Persia. May 15, 1097, the Christians
sat down before the place and began the siege.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crusading knights were clad in the hauberk, a
coat of mail made of rings of steel; all wore the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>casque, covered with iron for common soldiers, with
steel for untitled knights, and with silver to denote
the princely rank. Horsemen carried round, square,
or kite-shaped shields; footmen longer ones, made
ordinarily of elm, which protected the entire body.
Helmets of steel or chain hoods covered the head.
The weapons of offence were the lance of ash tipped
with steel, the sword, often of enormous length and
weight, to be wielded with both hands, the axe, the
mace, the poniard, the club, the sling, and, what at
that time was a novelty to the Turks and Greeks, the
crossbow of steel, which Anna Comnena called a
“thoroughly diabolical device.” The knight’s horse
was usually a heavy beast, whose tough muscles were
needed to carry the weighty armament mounted upon
his back, together with his own housings, which consisted
of a saddle plated with steel, gathered as a
breastplate in front and projecting backward so as to
protect the flanks and loins. The horse’s head was
likewise hooded with metal, ornamented between the
eyes with a short, sharp pike like the horn of the unicorn.
But, notwithstanding the burden he carried,
the knight acquired by discipline a marvellous celerity
of movement, often baffling the anticipation of the
most wary antagonist, while in the crash of conflict
he bore down his foe with superior weight. In the
train of the crusading knight were carried the materials
for the erection of rams with which to batter down
walls, catapults to hurl huge rocks, and siege-castles,
or movable towers, which overtopped the opposing
defences and were provided with bridges to let down
upon the walls.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>The Turkish or Saracen soldier was more lightly
accoutred. His horse was of more slender mould,
deep-winded, and fleet of limb. In the encounter
the rider depended upon the momentum acquired
by celerity rather than that of weight. The long
but light spear, brandished rather than couched, the
crescent-shaped, slender, but well-tempered cimeter,
the shield of leather, made, where attainable, of rhinoceros’s
hide rather than of metal, the light bow,
the quiver filled with nicely balanced arrows, the
many folds of the muslin turban which protected the
head from the Eastern sun—these made an almost
ideal contrast with the appearance of his Western
antagonist when upon the march. The armor of
Christian and Moslem, so diverse, necessitated manœuvres
in the battle which in their first encounters
were almost equally bewildering to both contestants.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the assault upon Nicæa the Christians numbered
upward of a quarter of a million men. Against them
Kilidge-Arslan had at least one hundred thousand and
the advantage of the city fortifications. The place
was encircled with a double line of walls, surmounted
by three hundred and seventy towers, and guarded
from approach by a deep canal or moat. On the east
high mountains obstructed the way; on the west and
south the Lake of Ascanius prevented attack, while
it gave the besieged an outlet to the sea, through
which they could replenish their provisions and ranks
in spite of their foes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Christians were divided into nineteen different
camps, representing as many different nations. Their
habit of fighting, not on extensive battle lines, but in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>groups about the standards of their special leaders,
gave plausibility to the declaration of Kilidge-Arslan,
as he viewed the invaders from his mountain outlook,
that “disorder reigned in their army” and that their
very numbers insured their defeat. With tremendous
vigor, he hurled his forces in two divisions upon the
camps of Godfrey and Raymond. The Christians
were dislodged from their defences as bowlders from
their places by a spring freshet. It seemed that they
must be swept away in the impetuous torrent, but
quickly the tide of battle turned, and the Turks were
driven back to their mountain fortresses. Again they
descended, but only to cover the field with their dead,
as the exhausted freshet leaves upon the ground it
has inundated the débris it brought down from the
hills, while the rocks it assailed still lie near the position
where they sustained the assault. The brutality
that distempered the age was illustrated by the Christian
victors, who severed many heads from the bodies
of the slain and slung them as trophies from their
saddle-bows. With ghoulish pride, they hurled a
thousand of them from their catapults into the city.
One of these “soldiers of the cross,” Anselme of Ribemont,
wrote to the Archbishop of Rheims: “Our men,
returning in victory and bearing many heads fixed
upon pikes, furnished a joyful spectacle for the people
of God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One line of walls soon fell beneath the rams of the
besiegers, but it only revealed another within. The
Christians dragged vessels overland from Civitat (the
modern Guemlik), and by night launched them upon
the Lake of Ascanius, thus cutting off reinforcement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>for the garrison within the city. After seven weeks
of almost incredible effort, Nicæa was about to fall to
the reward of its Latin conquerors, when suddenly
there appeared upon the ramparts numerous strange
standards. To the amazement of the Christians, these
proved to be not those of the Turk, but of the Greek.
Alexius, conniving with the enemy, had surreptitiously
introduced into Nicæa a detachment of his
own troops, and thus secured the surrender to himself
of what had been won by others. The rage of
the crusaders knew no bounds. With the price of
their blood they had gained nothing but the honor
of their valor. Only the utmost discretion on the part
of the chieftains prevented the army from declaring
war upon Alexius and marching back to the capture of
Constantinople. It afterwards transpired that Alexius’s
movement had been encouraged by some of the
leaders of the crusade, that their armies might not be
weakened by leaving garrisons to hold the captured
places.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>
  <h3 id='chap13' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirteen'>XIII.</abbr> <br> BATTLE OF DORYLÆUM—TARSUS—DEFECTION OF BALDWIN.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>From Nicæa the Christians advanced (June
29, 1097) through Asia Minor towards
the Holy Land. Their march was over a
roadless country, threading the ravines
and climbing the precipices of mountains,
across plains desolated by the retreating foe, under
the burning heat of the midsummer sun, and exposed
to the guerilla attacks of a half-beaten enemy, whose
main army was rapidly recruiting and waiting with
double its former numbers to renew the battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to procure provisions, the crusaders divided
their forces—one band under Bohemond, Tancred,
Count Hugh, and Robert of Normandy, the other
under Godfrey, Raymond, Adhemar, and Robert of
Flanders. The former had camped with confident
security in a little valley near Dorylæum in Phrygia.
On the morning of July 1st sudden clouds of dust
appeared on the height above, and a storm of arrows
and missiles announced the attack of Kilidge-Arslan.
Bohemond had scarcely arranged his people for battle
when the Turks were upon him. With their lighter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>armor and swifter steeds, they circled about the Christians,
delivering volleys of arrows, and escaping before
the assault could be returned, as hawks might assail
a lion. If a valiant band of Christians pursued them
they dispersed in every direction, only to form again
in a circle and repeat their murderous attack. Many
of the most valiant Christian knights fell without
being able to return a stroke. The Turkish numbers
were being constantly augmented by new arrivals.
Kilidge-Arslan, at the head of a body of his braves,
made a sudden raid upon the Christian camp, massacring
the men and children and carrying off the
women for his seraglios.</p>

<p class='c007'>But a bitter vengeance was taken. Robert of Normandy,
snatching his white banner, drove through the
densest ranks of the foe with the watchword of “Deus
vult!” followed by Tancred, who was made doubly
valiant by having seen his brother William fall, pierced
with arrows. The captives were rescued, but the
crusaders were exhausted, and retired in despair behind
the stockade of their camp. At noon, however,
the air was rent with new trumpet-calls. The hilltop
shone with the armor of the knights under Godfrey.
The charge of this redoubtable warrior and fifty
chosen comrades broke upon the Turks like a thunderbolt.
The opportune arrival of Raymond gave
the crusaders fifty thousand fresh horsemen, who
pursued the now panic-stricken enemy over the
mountain. Three thousand Turkish officers and a
measureless multitude of men were slain. The camp
of Kilidge-Arslan was taken, and the crusaders pursued
their way, laden with provision and treasures.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Mounted on the horses of their foes, they pursued the
flying remnant. To complete the enthusiasm of victory,
it was alleged that <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> George and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Demetrius
had been seen fighting in the Christian ranks. For
many generations the peasants of that neighborhood
believed that once a year <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> George, on horseback,
with lance in hand, could be seen by the worshippers
in the little church which was erected on the spot to
commemorate his timely apparition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crusaders marched from the field of Dorylæum
to new terrors, against which it was not the province
of sword or lance to contend. The scattered Turks
devastated the country along the line of march.
Neither field nor bin was left to be plundered.
The roots of wild plants were at times the only food
of the pursuers. The July sun, always terrific in what
the ancients called “burning Phrygia,” beat upon
them with unusual balefulness. Falcons, which the
knights had brought along to relieve the tedium of
the journey, fell dead from their masters’ arms.
Many women gave untimely birth to offspring, which
perished in their first efforts to inhale the hot atmosphere.
Five hundred of the hapless multitude died
between a sunrise and sunset. One day some dogs,
which had wandered off, returned with moist sand
upon their paw’s and coats; they had found water.
Following the trail of the brutes, the soldiers discovered
a mountain stream. The men plunged into it
and drank so abundantly that the multitude became
water drunk; thus three hundred perished with the
fever flush of new-found life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Passing through Cilicia, the advance under Tancred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>captured Tarsus, the birthplace of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul. But
Baldwin, brother of Godfrey, contested with Tancred
the honor of its possession and a share of its spoil.
Tancred refused to allow either his own men or those
of Baldwin to loot the place, saying that he had not
taken arms to pillage Christians. His flag was torn
from the ramparts and flung into the ditch. By a
display of moral courage equal to his physical prowess,
Tancred restrained his resentment, that the Christian
host might not be divided. Baldwin, left in possession
of a part of the town, refused admission to a
company of crusaders, who, thus left exposed without
the walls, were massacred by the Turks. Popular
indignation ran high against Baldwin, which he
ultimately assuaged by taking a horrible vengeance
upon the Turks remaining in Tarsus, not one of whom
he left alive.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crusaders at Tarsus received reinforcements
by the arrival of a fleet of Flemish and Dutch pirates,
who, by the bribe of expected spoil, were induced to
sew the cross upon their garments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving a garrison in this city, Baldwin followed
eastward in the track of Tancred, whom he overtook
at Malmistra. The rage of the soldiers of Tancred
against him could not be checked by the mild counsel
of their leader, whom they taunted with weakness.
For once the self-restraint of Tancred gave way.
He led his men against Baldwin. A pitched battle
ensued, followed on the morrow by the embrace of
the leaders in the presence of their troops, and vows
to expiate their mutual offences in fresh blood of the
common enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The popularity of Tancred ill suited the ambition
of his rival. Baldwin, seemingly stung by the withdrawal
of the confidence of his brethren, nursed the
project of leaving the crusading army and setting up
a kingdom for himself. He offered his aid to Thoros,
the Armenian Prince of Edessa, in Mesopotamia, who
was at that time warring on his own account against
the Turks beyond the Euphrates. None of the
crusading chiefs seconded Baldwin’s project. With
eighty knights and one thousand foot-soldiers, he
traversed the deserts. Upon his arrival at Edessa, in
the strange custom of the country the aged Thoros
and his wife pressed the count to their naked breasts,
thus acknowledging him as son by adoption. The
fable of him who had warmed a serpent in his bosom
only to feel its sting was repeated in this case. With
Baldwin’s knowledge, if not with his connivance, an
insurrection was stirred against Thoros, which resulted
in his being flung from the wall of his own castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baldwin, thus installed in chief authority, confirmed
his hold upon the people by marrying an Armenian
princess. All Mesopotamia acknowledged him, and
a Frankish knight was seen reigning on the Euphrates
over the richest part of ancient Assyria.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defection of Baldwin was not ultimately detrimental
to the crusades, since his kingdom made a
barrier on the north and east against the Turkish and
Saracenic hordes, and prevented their interfering more
readily with the Christians’ march upon Jerusalem,
of which Baldwin himself was one day to be king.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
  <h3 id='chap14' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='fourteen'>XIV.</abbr> <br> BEFORE ANTIOCH.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The crusading hosts passed, with incredible
toil and suffering, through the remainder
of Asia Minor. The perils of the Taurus
chain of mountains nearly brought them
to despair. Borne down with their heavy
arms, encumbered with thousands of women and children,
they passed along paths which the practised feet
of mountaineers were alone fitted to tread. In the
defiles were left many who could not climb the precipitous
rocks, which thus became the walls of their
tomb. At the base of the palisades were heaps of
armor, which their wearers were too spiritless to recover.
But in spite of the despair of many, the leaders
evidently did not leave the spoil of war to rust or
decay in the cañons of the Taurus. Stephen of Blois
wrote to his wife a few weeks later than the events
we are describing: “You may know for certain, my
beloved, that of gold, silver, and many other kinds
of riches I now have twice as much as your love had
assigned to me when I left you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At length the survivors emerged to look down from
the mountains upon the borders of Syria. The sight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>inspired them as that from Pisgah did the invader of
old. Courage revived, and with joy they hastened
southward. Hard by was the battle-field of Issus,
where Alexander the Great, the man from the West,
had broken the power of the East under Xerxes—an
omen of its repetition. Soon Antioch, the city built
to commemorate the fame of Antiochus, one of Alexander’s
generals, stood before them. The rumor of
their invincibility had served the crusaders in the stead
of battles, and October 21, 1097, they sat down unmolested
for the siege of the Syrian capital.</p>

<p class='c007'>This city, where a thousand years before believers
were first called Christians, still wore in the reverence
of all the world the honor of that initial christening.
It was called the “Eldest Daughter of Sion,” and was
the seat of one of the original patriarchates into which
the early church was divided. It had been the third
city of the Roman world, and those who were unimpressed
with its sacred story could imagine its splendor
when it was called the “Queen of the East.”
Paganism once worshipped obscene divinities in its
famous groves of Daphne. About it still stood the
enormous wall built by the Emperor Justinian five
hundred years before, on every tower of which were
mementos of sieges when it had been captured alternately
by Saracen and Greek, and now, but thirteen
years before the crusaders’ coming, by Solyman, the
Turk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The natural defences of Antioch, supplemented by
those of art, made it impregnable, except to the enthusiastic
faith of such men as now essayed its capture.
On the north it was guarded by the river
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Orontes, on the south by natural heights of several
hundred feet, on the west by the great citadel, and
on the east by a castle. The wall which bound together
the various fortifications was nine miles in extent,
strengthened by three hundred and sixty towers.
A deep cleft in the southern height poured a mountain
torrent through the city to the Orontes. Accian,
grandson of Malek-Shah, had twenty thousand Turks
within the walls, who behind such battlements were
presumably the match for the three hundred thousand
crusaders who are said to have been without.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the sanguine enthusiasm of the Christians the
city seemed like a ripened fruit ready to fall into the
hand at a touch. Guards appeared upon the walls,
but the challenge of their camps provoked no response.
This the Christians interpreted as a sign of
the feebleness and dismay of the garrison. They
were disposed to wait for the fruit to fall of itself.
The genial influence of the climate soon wrought its
softness into nerve and spirit. Discipline was relaxed;
knights whose shields showed many a dent of conflict
spent the hours among the vineyards, where the
luscious clusters still hung upon their stems. Adventure
found its pastime in discovering the vaults
in which the peasants had hidden their grain. If
we could believe the theory that good and evil people
leave in the places they frequent an atmosphere of
virtue or vice, to invigorate or infect the souls of those
who come after them, we might think that the soldiers
of the cross had succumbed to the influence of the
votaries of Venus and Adonis, who anciently revelled
in the grove of Daphne; for the Christian host became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>infatuated with unseemly pleasures; they were given
over to intemperance and debauchery. An arch-deacon
was not ashamed to be seen in dalliance with
a Syrian nymph.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the leaders did not yield to the prevalent vice,
they seem to have been infected with that intellectual
dulness and lethargy of purpose which follows license.
They neglected to prepare their siege machinery, and
when a momentary enthusiasm led them to attack
the walls they paid for their temerity with failure.
The enemy became correspondingly emboldened, and
retaliated with fearful forays through the Christian
lines. With the approach of winter the crusaders
had exhausted their provisions, and the country about
furnished no more. Heavy rainfalls reduced their
camps to swamps, in which the bow lost its stiffness,
and the body its vigor, making the men the prey
of diseases which kept them busy burying their dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stories of disasters to the cause elsewhere floated
to them, until the air seemed laden with evil omens.
Sweno, Prince of Denmark, had advanced through
Cappadocia. At his side was Florine, daughter of
Count Eudes of Burgundy, his affianced bride. Together
they fought their way through countless
swarms of Turks, until, with all their attendant
knights, they were slain. The body of this heroic
woman showed that seven arrows had penetrated her
armor. News also came that fleets of Pisans and
Genoese, their allies, had withdrawn from the coast,
lured by better prospects of gain than in bringing
succor to what seemed a ruined cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such was the moral depression that Robert of Normandy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>deserted for a while, until shame brought him
back. His example was followed even by Peter the
Hermit, “a star fallen from heaven,” says Guibert,
the eye-witness and chronicler. Peter, however, returned
at the entreaty of Tancred, whose heart was
as true in trouble as his eye was keen in the mêlée.
The Hermit was made to take oath never again to
desert the cause he had once so eloquently proclaimed.
The piety of Adhemar, Bishop of Puy, instituted fasts
and penitential processions around the camp, to purge
it of iniquity and to avert the wrath of Heaven. The
practical judgment of the chieftains enacted terrible
punishments to curb the unreasoning debauchery.
The drunkard was cropped of his hair, the gambler
branded with a hot iron, the adulterer stripped naked
and beaten in the presence of the camp. The Syrian
spies who were caught were, by order of Bohemond,
spitted and roasted, and this proclamation was posted
over them: “In this manner all spies shall make meat
for us with their bodies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time there arrived in the camp an embassy
from the caliph of Egypt. The race of Ali
hated the Turks as the usurpers of the headship of
their faith, and proposed alliance with the Christians
to expel them from Jerusalem. They stipulated for
themselves the sovereignty of Palestine, and would
grant to the disciples of Jesus perpetual privilege of
pilgrimage to the sacred places. If this offer of the
caliph was declined, the ambassadors presented the
alternative of war, not only with the Turks, but with
the combined Saracen world from Gibraltar to Bagdad.
The Christian reply was bold. Their orators
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>taunted the Egyptians with the diabolical cruelty they
had once practised when Jerusalem was under Hakim,
and declared that they would brave the wrath of the
Moslem world rather than permit a stone of the sacred
city to be possessed by an enemy of their faith. This
reply was saved from seeming bravado by an opportune
victory. Bohemond and Raymond met and cut
to pieces a Moslem force of twenty thousand horsemen,
who were advancing from the north for the
relief of Antioch. As the ambassadors of Egypt
were embarking, they were presented with four
camel-loads of human heads, to impress their master
with the sincerity of the Christian boast, while hundreds
more of these ghastly tokens were stuck upon
pikes before the walls or flung by the ballistæ into
the city to terrorize the defendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fearfulness of their extremity animated the
courage of the Turks as it had often done that of the
Christians; for brave hearts are the same, under whatever
faith and culture. They sallied from the gates,
which by the orders of Accian were closed behind
them until they should return as victors. At nightfall,
however, but few lived to seek the entrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their valor was doubtless as fine as that of the
Christians, the exploits of whose leaders have come
to us in story and song. Tancred’s deeds were so
great that, either from excessive modesty or the fear
that nobody would believe such wonders, he exacted
a promise of his squire never to tell what his master
had wrought. If his great actions were like most
reported of his comrades, we can admire his wisdom
as well as his humility; for the legends of the battle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>tell, among other wonders, of a monster Turk who
was cloven in twain by the sword of Godfrey, and
one half of whose lifeless body rode his charger back
to the gate. A less glorious exploit is mentioned.
The Christians rifled by night the new-made graves
of the Moslems, and paraded the next day in the
clothes of the fallen braves, carrying upon their pikes
instead of garlands fifteen hundred heads they had
severed from the corpses. A more romantic scene
makes a pleasant foil to this: the children of either
side, drilled by their seniors, engaged in battle in
presence of both armies. Hands that could not use
the sword thrust with the dagger, and the poisoned
tip of the arrow was not less deadly because it was
sent from a tiny bow.</p>

  <h3 id='chap15' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='fifteen'>XV.</abbr> <br> THE FALL OF ANTIOCH.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>After seven months of valorous assault
and defence, Antioch at length was gained.
It fell, however, not as the prize of honorable
conquest, but as the price of treachery,
disgraceful to both those within and
those without the walls. Phirous, an Armenian
Christian, had abjured his faith in order to secure
promotion in the Turkish service. In reward he was
given position, and now commanded three of the
principal towers. Divining a similar, if not equal,
unconscionableness in Bohemond, Phirous made
known to him his willingness to recant his new vows
as a Moslem and again betray his trust for larger reward
in the Christian ranks. Bohemond announced
to the other chiefs his possession of a secret by which
Antioch might easily be taken, but refused to reveal
it except upon their agreement to assign to him the
independent sovereignty of the Syrian capital. The
proposal at first met with the contempt and rage of
his fellow-leaders, which were expressed to his face
in the hot words of Raymond, who declared that
Bohemond proposed to “repay with the conquests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of valor some shameful artifice worthy of women.”
Bohemond was as brazen as he was brave, and endured
this insult. Reports became rife that Kerbogha,
Sultan of Mosul, was advancing to the relief
of his coreligionists. Bohemond, through his emissaries,
magnified the alarm until the besiegers anticipated
the attack of an army of two hundred thousand,
whose cimeters were dripping with the blood
of victory over all the peoples west of the Euphrates.
Under this menace the chiefs chose the valor of discretion,
and, not without lamentation at the shameful
necessity, yielded to the ambition of their comrade.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scheme of Phirous came near miscarriage at
the very moment of execution. Accian, the commandant
at Antioch, suspicious of treachery, ordered
all the Christians in the city to be seized and massacred
that very night. Summoning Phirous, he
subjected him to severest examination, but the
shrewdness of the wretch completely veiled his duplicity.
Phirous tried to induce his own brother to
join him in his treachery. The man refused, and,
lest he should reveal the plot, Phirous plunged his
dagger to his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>A comet, which had appeared in the early evening
sky, was regarded as an omen favorable to the scheme.
The subsequent dense darkness of the night and the
roar of sudden storm shielded the forms and drowned
the footfalls of the plotters. At a given signal Phirous
dropped from the wall a ladder of leather, which was
quickly mounted by one of Bohemond’s men. As
the traitor Phirous stood by the parapet conversing
with the intruders, he was startled by the glare of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>lantern in the hand of an officer making his round of
inspection, but his ready tact diverted suspicion. The
agent of Bohemond descended the ladder and reported
all in readiness for the assault; but the Christians
were held back by a strange spell. Men who were
accustomed to brave death without a question at the
command of their princes, could not be prevailed upon
by either threatening or promise to venture into this
unknown danger. Moral courage is the strongest
stimulus to physical daring, and this treacherous
project failed to supply the heroic incentive. Bohemond
himself was compelled to set the perilous example;
but no one followed until he descended to
assure them by his presence that he had not fallen
into some deadly trap. Then one by one the bravest
knights, such as Foulcher of Chartres and the Count
of Flanders, emulated Bohemond’s bravery. The
parapet was overweighted by the assailants, who were
massed upon its edge, and gave way, precipitating
many upon the lance-points of those below them.
But the thunders of the storm drowned the crash of
the falling masonry. Securing the three towers of
Phirous’s command, the crusaders opened the city
gates to the dense ranks that waited without.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the cry of “Deus vult! Deus vult!” the infuriated
multitude poured into the city. The Moslems,
as they came from their homes and barracks
at the rude awakening, were slaughtered without
having time for resistance. Through all houses not
marked by some symbol of the Christian faith the
crusaders raged; cruelty and lust knew no restraint.
The dawn revealed over six thousand corpses in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>streets. Accian escaped the Christian soldiers, only
to meet a less honorable death at the hands of a
woodman while in flight through the forest. Phirous
was abundantly rewarded for his treachery, but two
years later he reëmbraced Moslemism in expectation
of larger gains. In the anathemas of Christian and
paynim he was consigned to the hell in which both
believed.</p>

  <h3 id='chap16' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='sixteen'>XVI.</abbr> <br> THE HOLY LANCE.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The elation of the crusaders over the possession
of Antioch was of briefest duration.
Their three days’ license, in the
enjoyment of what they had so ingloriously
won, was terminated on the fourth
day by fearful menace. Kerbogha was really coming.
To his own veteran experience he added the wisdom
of the most redoubtable sultans and emirs of Syria,
Asia Minor, and Persia, who commanded an army
of one hundred thousand horse and three hundred
thousand foot. So stealthily had they approached
that the news was conveyed to the Christians only
by their observing from the walls the advance of the
mighty host as it dashed through the camps but
recently consecrated to the cross. Quickly the Moslems
completed their investment of the city. The
Christians could make no foray over the fields, and
no provisions were allowed to reach them from the
port. To add to their fears, the citadel of Antioch
had not fallen into their hands with the rest of the
city, and was still occupied by watchful foes. They
were thus assailed from without and from within the
walls.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>The gay robes, costly gems, and arms which the
Christians had taken were no compensation for the
lack of provisions. Godfrey paid fifteen silver marks
for the flesh of a half-starved camel. Knights killed
for meat the proud chargers they loved oftentimes
more than they did their companions in arms, who
were now their greedy contestants for what scanty
provision remained. Common soldiers gnawed the
leather off shoes and shields, and some dug from the
graves and devoured the putrid flesh of the Turks they
had slain. We might doubt this horrible deed were not
similar acts of cannibalism confessed by Godfrey and
Raymond in a letter to the Pope, written a year later.
Every morning revealed the numbers of those who
had deserted during the night, among whom were
some of the most famous warriors, such as the counts
of Melun and Blois and Chartres. In the general
despair even faith gave way. Men cursed the God
who had deserted them while they were defending
His cause, and the priests hesitated to perform the
rites of religion among a people who had become as
infidel as the foe they sought to destroy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greek emperor, Alexius, started out from
Constantinople with an army, but upon hearing of
the desperate straits of the Latins returned, leaving
them to their fate. The Christians, it is said, offered
to capitulate to Kerbogha upon condition of being
permitted to return to Europe in abandonment of the
crusades. Godfrey and Adhemar, the one in the name
of all that was valiant among men, the other as the
representative of the Pope, presumably speaking for
Heaven, remonstrated in vain. The refusal of even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>so much mercy by the Moslems alone prevented the
consummation of this disgrace. The warriors who had
won the applause of Europe then sat sullenly in their
houses and could not be prevailed upon to fight along
the walls, believing that additional wounds would
only protract their woe without averting the final
catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this hour of abject despair the besieged were
reinspirited by an occasion which is as much the
marvel of the psychologist as of the historian. In
the prostration of bodily nature through hunger and
disease, imagination often tyrannizes the faculties.
Man becomes the prey of unrealities; his dreams
create a new world, generally of terror, but often of
hope. Then it is that the demons and angels of
theory materialize into seeming facts. Thus the
emaciated men in the beleaguered camp were ready
to believe the story of a priest, who related that
Christ had appeared to him, denouncing destruction
upon His faithless followers, but that at the intercession
of the Virgin Mary the Lord was appeased, and
promised immediate victory if the soldiers of His cross
would once more valiantly endeavor to merit it. At
the same time two deserters returned to the camp,
relating how the Saviour had met them and turned
them back from flight. But the crowning miracle
was revealed to the priest, Peter Barthelemi. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Andrew appeared to him and said, “Go to the church
of my brother <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter in Antioch. Near the principal
altar you will find, by digging into the earth, the
iron head of the lance which pierced the side of our
Redeemer. Within three days this instrument of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>salvation shall be manifested to His disciples. This
mystical iron, borne at the head of the army, shall
effect the deliverance of the Christians and shall pierce
the hearts of the Infidels.” For two days the people
fasted; on the morning of the third day twelve trusty
knights and ecclesiastics dug at the appointed spot,
while the multitude remained in silence and prayer
about the church. All day long they waited. At
midnight there was no response to their expectation.
As the twelve ceased their labors, and were bowed in
renewed petition around the excavation, Peter Barthelemi
suddenly leaped into the hole. In a moment
he reappeared bearing a lance-head in his hands.
The news spread through the city as if shouted by
angels. The effect upon the desponding minds of the
soldiers was like the revival of life in the dead bodies
of Ezekiel’s valley of vision. Some, it is true, shook
their heads, or, like Foulcher of Chartres, declared
that the lance had been concealed by Barthelemi in
the designated place. Whether really credulous, or
shrewd enough to try any new expedient, the leaders
were loudest in heralding the discovery as miraculous.</p>

<p class='c007'>Peter the Hermit was sent to announce to the
Moslems the decree of Heaven for their immediate
overthrow. Sultan Kerbogha, however, proved a
match for the zealot in vituperative bravado and
religious devotion. He haughtily declared but one
condition of his raising the siege, namely, the acknowledgment
by the Christians that “Allah is great,
and Mohammed is His prophet.” “Bid thy companions,”
said he to Peter, “take advantage of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>clemency; to-morrow they shall leave Antioch only
under the sword. They will then see if their crucified
God, who could not save Himself from the cross,
can save them from the fate I have prepared for
them.” With that he drove Peter and his band of
deputies back to their walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Christians ate that night what they deliberately
called their last supper in Antioch. With the
remnant of bread and wine they celebrated mass. At
dawn the city gates were thrown open, and in twelve
divisions the host marched out, following the standard
of the Holy Lance. The clergy went first, as in the
days of Jehoshaphat, singing their faith in coming
victory. The words of the psalm, “Let God arise,
and let His enemies be scattered,” seemed to be answered
by invisible hosts on the mountains, who took
up the crusaders’ war-cry of “Deus vult!” Excited
imaginations saw the mountains filled with the chariots
of the Lord, as in the days of Elisha. But to the eye
of flesh the Christian host presented a sorry spectacle.
Many limped with wounds or trudged slowly from
weakness; most were in rags, many were stark naked.
The prancing charger had been changed for a camel
or ass, and many a knight was reduced to the condition
of a foot-soldier, and shouldered his spear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sultan Kerbogha haughtily refused to leave a game
of chess he was playing, to listen to what he supposed
would be an entreaty for mercy from the entire
Christian army, that was coming to throw itself at his
feet; but he was soon undeceived. With sudden
dash, Count Hugh attacked and cut to pieces two
thousand of the enemy who guarded the bridge before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the city. The main body of Christians formed against
the mountains and, thus shielded from a rear attack,
advanced steadily upon the foe. The surprise of
Kerbogha did not prevent that experienced soldier
from seeing the advantage gained by his assailants.
Under flag of truce he proposed to decide the issue
by battle between an equal number of braves selected
from either side. The enthusiasm of the Christian
host forbade such a limitation of the honor of attaining
what seemed to all a certain victory. Heaven
gave manifest token of favor in a strong wind, that
sped the missiles of the crusaders, while it retarded
those of their foes. In vain did Kerbogha storm
them in front, while Kilidge-Arslan, having climbed
the mountain, attacked their rear. The Turks had
fired the bushes to bewilder the Christians, but
through a dense smoke there appeared a squadron
descending the mountains, led by three horsemen in
white and lustrous armor. These were recognized
as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> George, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Demetrius, and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Theodore, the
same materialized spirits that had been seen upon
the plains of Nicæa. With a superhuman fury and
strength, the Christians broke upon the Moslems as
a tornado upon a forest, making through the opposing
ranks a path of utter destruction. When this breath
of heaven had passed one hundred thousand Infidels
lay dead upon the field. Fifteen thousand camels, a
proportionate number of horses, immense stores of
provisions, and priceless treasures enriched the victors.
The tent of Kerbogha, capable of covering over two
thousand persons, glowing like a vast gem with jewels
and tapestries, was taken and sent to Italy, where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>sight of it inflamed the greed of new bands of crusaders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who are disinclined to believe in the heavenly
portents that aided the Christians may content
themselves with the explanation which the Moslem
writers give of their defeat. They relate that the
Arabs had quarrelled with the Turks, and retired from
the field before the battle; that the latter pursued
their coreligionists more bitterly than they fought the
common enemy. The credulity of the Christians also
abated when they discovered that the camps of Kerbogha
were more adorned than fortified. Then, too,
they recalled the skill and courage of their own assault,
and listened to the thousand stories of the
Christians’ exploit from the lips of the performers.
Pride, if not reason, triumphed over superstition, and
the Holy Lance fell into disparagement. A letter
from the leaders to Pope Urban, written from Antioch
just after this battle acknowledged that the divine
weapon “restored our strength and courage”; but
the writers are more particular to tell how “we had
learned the tactics of the foe” and, “by the grace and
mercy of God, succeeded in making them unite at
one point.” Later the Christian host was divided
into two parties, who contended violently for and
against the credibility of the miracle. Normans and
the crusaders from the north of France were rationalistically
inclined, while the men from the south
adhered to the story as told by their geographical
representative, Peter Barthelemi, the priest from
Marseilles, who had discovered the sacred symbol.
The veracity of Peter was finally subjected to trial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>by Ordeal. A vast pile of olive-branches was erected.
A passage several feet in width was left through the
middle of the heap. When the wood had been fired,
Peter appeared, bearing the Holy Lance. As he faced
the flames a herald cried, “If this man has seen Jesus
Christ face to face, and if the Apostle Andrew did
reveal to him the divine lance, may he pass safe and
sound through the flames; but if, on the contrary,
he be guilty of falsehood, may he be burned.” The
assembled host bowed and answered, “Amen.”
Peter ran with his best speed down the fiery aisle.
The furious heat impeded him. He seemed to have
fallen, and disappeared amid the crackling branches
and smoke. At length, however, he emerged at the
other end of the flaming avenue amid the cries of his
partisans, “A miracle! a miracle!” Yet the test
was indecisive, for, while Peter succeeded in running
the gantlet, he was terribly burned, and was carried
in mortal agony to the tent of Raymond, where a few
days later he expired. It is to be noted that from
that time the Holy Lance wrought no more miracles,
even in the credulity of its most reverent adorers.</p>

  <h3 id='chap17' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='seventeen'>XVII.</abbr> <br> ON TO JERUSALEM.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The zeal of the mass of crusaders urged
them to an immediate advance upon Jerusalem.
This, however, was opposed by
the discretion of Godfrey, who predicted
the hardship of the campaign in a Syrian
midsummer. The evident dissensions among the
Moslems and their apathy in further warfare, if they
gave opportunity for rapid conquest by the Christians,
at the same time allayed the feeling of necessity for
immediate advance. It was therefore resolved to
postpone the enterprise southward until November.</p>

<p class='c007'>While waiting for the order to march, an epidemic
broke out in the camps, which was more fatal than
would have been any perils of the journey. Upward
of fifty thousand perished in a month, among them
Adhemar, Bishop of Puy, the special representative
of the Holy Father, and the spiritual head of the
crusade. Idleness also engendered strife among
brethren. Bohemond and Raymond threatened each
other with the sword. Common soldiers fought in
opposing bands for the possession of the booty captured
in their raids. Restless spirits, disgusted with
the general apathy, joined Baldwin, now the master
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of Edessa. Some made alliance with such Moslems
as were at war with their fellow-Moslems. Even
Godfrey fought for the emir of Hezas against Redowan,
Sultan of Aleppo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heaven also seemed to have become impatient at
the inaction of the crusaders. A luminous mass, as
if all the stars had combined their fires, like a suspended
thunderbolt, glared down from the sky upon
the quiet ramparts of Antioch. Suddenly it burst
and scattered in sparks through the air. Did it mean
that God was about to thus disperse the Christians,
or that He would scatter their enemies? The omen,
though not clearly interpreted, sufficed to rouse the
indolent host.</p>

<p class='c007'>Raymond and Bohemond, with worthy compeers,
assaulted Maarah, between Hamath and Aleppo. A
novelty of the defence of this place was the hurling
upon the assailants of hives filled with stinging bees.
The resistance of the inhabitants, however, proved
unavailing, and was punished by their indiscriminate
massacre when the city had been gained. A dispute
between Raymond and Bohemond for sole possession
of what they had jointly conquered delayed further
operations, until the soldiers who were left in Maarah
with their own hands destroyed the fortifications, and
thus rendered it useless to the ambition of either of
the leaders.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not until far into the year that the united
host took up the march southward. Everywhere
they were lured from their grand objective, the sacred
city, by the sight of goodly lands and strong towers,
the spoil or possession of which might compensate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the sacrifices of the campaign. Raymond laid siege
to Arkas, at the foot of the Lebanons; others captured
Tortosa.</p>

<p class='c007'>While detained before the walls of Arkas they
were met by an embassy from the caliph of Egypt,
composed of the same persons that had previously
visited the camp at Antioch. They narrated how they
had been thrown into prison because of the failure of
their former mission, when their master heard of the
straits of the Christians; and how they had been liberated
and sent back upon his hearing of the subsequent
triumph of the Latins. They announced that Jerusalem
had recently come into the hands of the Egyptians,
and as its new possessors, proposed peace and
privilege of pilgrimage to all who should enter the city
without arms. They offered splendid bribes to the
chieftains in person; but these worthies rejected the
proposal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fame of the Christians’ victory at Antioch
brought new crusaders from Europe, among them
Edgar Atheling, the last Saxon claimant of the crown
of England against its possession by William the
Conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the way southward the hosts harvested the
groves of olives and oranges, and the waving fields
which have always enriched the western slopes of
Lebanon. They discovered a rare plant, juicy and
sweet, refreshing like wine and nourishing as corn.
The inhabitants called it <i>zucra</i>. The later crusaders
introduced it as the sugar-cane into Italy. Proceeding
along or near to the coast, that they might be able
to receive succor from over the sea, they traversed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the plain of Berytus (Beirut) and the territory of
Tyre and Sidon. Many pilgrims, whose zealotry had
led them to settle in the Holy Land notwithstanding
its hostile possession, hailed their brethren with benedictions
and provisions. On the bank of the river
Eleuctra their camp was invaded by hosts of serpents,
whose bite was followed by violent and often mortal
pains. At Ptolemaïs (Jean d’Acre) the commanding
emir averted assault by pledging himself to surrender
the place as soon as he should learn that the Christians
had taken Jerusalem. His pretence of peaceableness
was singularly exposed. A hawk was seen
to fly aloft with a dove in its talons. By strange
chance the lifeless bird fell amid a group of crusaders.
It proved to be a carrier-pigeon, whose peculiar instinct
was then unknown to Europeans. Under its
wing was a letter written by the emir of Ptolemaïs
to the emir of Cæsarea, containing the words: “The
cursed race of Christians has just passed through my
territories and will soon cross yours. Let all our
chiefs be warned and prepare to crush them.” This
timely revelation of the treachery of their assumed
ally, coming literally down from the sky, was regarded
as a special sign of Heaven’s favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pressing still southward, they captured Lydda and
Ramleh, on the road between Jaffa and Jerusalem.
Here the enthusiasm of the Christians blinded their
judgment. It was with difficulty that the more cautious
leaders restrained the multitude from moving
against Egypt, in the vain expectation of conquering
not only Jerusalem, but the ancient empire of the
Pharaohs, at a single swoop. The credulity as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Heaven’s favor was matched by an equal display of
very earthly motives. The crusaders devised a system
for dividing the spoil. Whatever leader first planted
his standard upon a city, or his mark upon the door
of a house, was to be regarded as its legitimate owner.
This appeal to human greed led many to leave the
direct march upon Jerusalem, which was but sixteen
miles away, and to expend in petty conquests or
robberies the ardor which for weary months had been
augmenting as they approached the grand object of
the crusades. A faithful multitude, however, pushed
on. They took off their shoes as they realized that
they were on holy ground. Tancred, with a band of
three hundred, making a circuit southward by night,
set the standard of the cross on the walls of Bethlehem,
to signal the birth of the kingdom in the birthplace of
its King.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the morning of June 10, 1099, the sight of the
Holy City broke upon the view. The shout of the
host, “Deus vult! Deus vult!” rolled over the intervening
hills like the “noise of many waters.”
Had a host of angels filled the sky, it would have
seemed to their enthusiastic souls but a fitting concomitant
of their approach. The joy of the apparent
accomplishment of their purpose was, however, followed
by the affliction of their souls, as the most devout
among them reminded the others of the spiritual
significance of the scene before them. Jerusalem had
witnessed the death of their Lord. For a while the
soldier remembered only that he was a pilgrim;
knight and pikeman knelt together and laid their
faces in the dust.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>
  <h3 id='chap18' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='eighteen'>XVIII.</abbr> <br> THE CAPTURE OF JERUSALEM.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The Egyptian commandant of Jerusalem
had not idly awaited the slow approach
of its assailants. He had stored it abundantly
with provisions, strengthened the
walls with masonry and defensive machines,
and by appeals to Moslems everywhere had
completed its garrison. The suburban country was
reduced to a desert, stripped of all vegetation which
could furnish food for man or beast; all standing trees,
and the timber in houses that might be wrought into
machinery of assault, were destroyed. The wells in
the valleys were filled with stones, and poison thrown
into the cisterns where water had been stored.</p>

<p class='c007'>Possibly the knowledge that the district about Jerusalem
could furnish them no help led the leaders to
listen to the counsel of a solitary hermit who dwelt
on the Mount of Olives, and who promised in Christ’s
name a successful assault if undertaken at once. It
does not seem clear how an army without siege apparatus
could take a place so strongly fortified. On the
east the vast walls, rising from the valley of Jehoshaphat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>were too lofty to tempt the most daring. Those
on the south, overlooking the Kidron, were not less
impregnable. The crusading army took every possibility
of approach into consideration, and in imitation
of Vespasian and Titus a thousand years before,
stretched their lines on the north and west of the city.
But only a blind faith in divine assistance could have
led to the assault, even on these sides, without battering-rams
or scaling-ladders. Yet at the trumpet’s call
the Christians advanced. They joined their shields
into a roof, which was a poor defence against the
stones and boiling oil that descended upon them.
Still the front ranks dug into the walls with pikes
and axes, while the rear ranks of archers and slingers
endeavored to drive the foe from the ramparts above.
A few, finding a solitary ladder, mounted the walls,
but were unable to withstand the crowd of Infidels
who met them. In deep discouragement, they abandoned
the assault, having learned the lesson that, even
at Jerusalem, Heaven assures no enterprise which is
conceived regardless of human discretion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Events soon occurred which turned this distrust of
miraculous intervention into a belief that Heaven was
actually fighting against the Christians. It was a
summer of fearful heat even for that land. Tasso’s
description of those fiery days is as truthful as it is
poetic:</p>

<p class='c014'>To avoid the burning atmosphere which drained
their blood, men buried themselves naked in the
ground. At night they sought to gather the dew,
with which to moisten their lips. Those who found
some tiny pool fought among themselves for the possession
of its foul water. It seemed that the very
“stars fought in their courses” against the people of
God, as once against Sisera. The occasional raids of
Moslems upon defenceless bands of Christians, as they
wandered in search of relief, were magnified by general
fear into the approach of vast armies. It was
rumored that Egypt had massed its power and was
approaching from the south.</p>

<p class='c007'>But for opportune relief it is probable that the
crusaders would have been compelled to raise the
siege. At the most critical moment some Genoese
ships entered Jaffa. Three hundred of the bravest
knights fought their way through the Moslems who
obstructed the road to the coast, and succeeded in
bringing to the camp before Jerusalem a quantity of
provisions and material for siege machinery, as well
as a number of skilled engineers and artisans. They
were unable to prevent the ships being destroyed by
the enemy. Gathering new courage from this reinforcement,
a band penetrated to the forests of Samaria,
full thirty miles distant, and cut timber, which, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>incredible toil, they brought back for the construction
of battering-rams, catapults, and strong roofs under
which to conduct their renewed operations. Among
the most formidable contrivances was the movable
tower, three stories high, within the base of which
men worked with levers to move the structure close
to the walls, while on the upper floors soldiers were
massed, who at the lowering of the drawbridge descended
upon the ramparts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Encouraged by this material aid, the crusaders
again sought the heavenly succor. They remembered
that Joshua combined faith with valor, and that, having
invested Jericho with prayers and psalms, its walls
fell down. They would now repeat the experiment.
For three days they held a solemn fast. On the
fourth, preceded by the priests bearing images of the
saints, with song and cymbals and trumpet, and burnished
arms flashing in the hot air, they set out for the
mystic investment of the frowning walls of Jerusalem.
Beginning on the west, the procession moved northward.
The entire army worshipped prostrate at the
tombs of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mary and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Stephen. Bending their
course to the southeast, they wept at the reputed
garden of Gethsemane. They then went up the
Mount of Olives, and there, on the spot whence
Christ had ascended, held a grand convocation. At
their feet lay the landscape, hallowed by the exploits
of Hebrew patriots and prophets, but chiefly by the
footprints of the Son of God. On the one hand
gleamed the Jordan and the Dead Sea; on the other
was Jerusalem, like an altar overturned and desecrated
by the presence of the heathen. Their most eloquent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>orator, Arnold de Rohes, harangued them as he
pointed to the dome of the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, the grand objective of all their toil, heroism,
and piety. Chieftains who had long cherished
mutual animosity, like Tancred and Raymond, stood
together in the embrace of forgiveness and the pledge
to forget all their differences, while their hearts were
reunited as in a celestial flame.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moslems themselves added fuel to the fire of
Christian enthusiasm by parading on the walls of the
city with crosses, which they saluted with blasphemous
gestures and cries. Peter the Hermit voiced the fresh
fury which swayed all breasts. He cried, “Ye see,
ye hear, the blasphemies of the enemies of God.
Swear to defend the Christ, a second time a prisoner,
crucified afresh. I swear by your faith, I swear by
your arms, that these mosques shall again serve for
temples of the true God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Descending from the Mount of Olives, the procession
moved southward, paying reverence at the Pool
of Siloam and the tomb of David. As the red sun
was setting in the white gleam of the Mediterranean,
the host returned to their camps on the west of the
city, chanting the words of Isaiah: “So shall they
fear the name of the Lord from the west, and His
glory from the rising of the sun.” In strange attestation
of the unity of religious sentiment in antagonistic
faiths, the songs of the Christians were echoed
from the city by the voices of the muezzins, who,
from the minarets of mosques, called their faithful to
prayer.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the night Godfrey made a rapid change in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>his point of attack, so that in the morning the bewildered
Moslems saw the walls threatened where they
had made little preparation for defence. A great ravine
which thwarted the operations of Raymond was
quickly filled by the multitude, who rushed amid the
thick rain of arrows, carrying stones, which they
threw into it.</p>

<p class='c007'>At daybreak, July 14, 1099, as from a single impulse,
the rams began their blows; the catapults and
ballistæ filled the air with flying stones and blazing
combustibles, and a storm of arrows swept the walls.
The assault was met with equal skill and courage,
and night fell upon an indecisive engagement. Raymond’s
tower had been destroyed, and those of Godfrey
and Tancred were injured so that they could not
be moved.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <abbr title='fifteenth'>15th</abbr> of July witnessed a repetition of the carnage.
The priests kept up an unceasing procession
of prayer around the city, a pious exhibition, which
was matched by the appearance on the walls of
two Moslem sorceresses, who, as the Christians said,
invoked the aid of nature and demons. In vain was
the heroism and sacrifices of the crusaders. Their
towers were burned and fell, burying their defenders
beneath the blazing fagots. The host was beginning
to withdraw from the seemingly useless slaughter.
Suddenly the cry, “Look! look!” directed all eyes
towards the Mount of Olives. The imagination of
some one had seen—or his shrewdness, recalling the
ruse of the Holy Lance at Antioch, had invented—the
apparition of a gigantic knight on the sacred mount,
waving his shield. The cry of “<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> George! <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>George!” rent the air. A timely change in the wind
blew the flames and smoke of the Christians’ remaining
towers towards the walls. The Moslems were
blinded and choked as by the breath of unearthly
spirits. Godfrey’s men rushed upon them, drove
them from their defences, and, climbing over the wall,
pursued them down through the streets of the city.
Tancred obtained a similar advantage, and in another
torrent poured his contingent over the northern end
of the ramparts. The Christians within the city opened
the gates, and new tides of slaughter and victory rolled
among the houses. Last of all, Raymond carried the
battlements which opposed him; thus the various
bands met within the city. One rally of the Moslems
checked but for an instant the inevitable result.</p>

<p class='c007'>The valor of this last effort of the defendants might
have elicited the magnanimity of the victors for so
worthy a foe, but it only enraged their brutality.
They who paused long enough in the carnage to remember
that it was Friday, and the very hour when
Christ died in love for all men, did not remember the
simplest precepts of their holy religion, and visited
their now unresisting enemies with slaughter unsurpassed
in the annals of cruelty. Neither age nor sex
was spared. Children’s brains were dashed out against
the stones, or their living bodies were whirled in demoniacal
sport from the walls. Women were outraged.
Men were prodded with spears over the
battlements upon other spears below, or were reserved
to be roasted by slow fires amid the mockeries
of their captors. In the letter sent by Godfrey and
others to the Pope occur these words: “If you desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>to know what was done with the enemy who were
found there, know that in Solomon’s porch and in his
temple our men rode in the blood of the Saracen up
to the knees of their horses.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both Latin and Oriental historians give seventy
thousand as the number of Mussulmans who were
massacred after the capture, besides those who fell in
the fight. It is certain that the entire population that
did not escape from the city were intended for death,
for such was the deliberate decree of the council of
chiefs. The blood-crazed soldiers extended the scope
of this outrageous mandate to include the Jews, who
perished in the flames of their synagogue. From
their hiding-places in mosques, homes, and the vast
underground vaults, the citizens were plucked out by
the point of the lance and sword. Thus many a
Moslem died in the confirmed belief of the superior
humanity of his own religion, though it was called the
religion of the sword.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only apology for this cruelty that can be given
is the brutality of manhood in these dark ages. The
gentler Christianity of earlier days had been sadly
changed by the propensities of the semi-barbaric
Northern conquerors who embraced it. The church
had as yet been able to affect the masses with only
its dogmas and ritual, not with its deeper and more
truly religious influence for the restraint of passion
and the tuition of the sentiment of love. The military
spirit, too, had allied itself with the ecclesiastical; as
Milman says, “The knight before the battle was as
devout as the bishop; the bishop in the battle no less
ferocious than the knight.” The truth of this is evident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>from the fact that contemporary writers do not
attempt to excuse it, but glory in sights the imagination
of which appals our modern sensibilities. Raymond
d’Agiles, an eye-witness, speaks with pleasantry
of the headless trunks and bodies dancing on ropes
from the turrets. The ghost of the dead Adhemar
was seen in his ecclesiastical robes partaking of the
triumph, but those who describe the vision report no
rebuke from his lips for the carnage. Tancred and
Raymond of Toulouse alone seem to have raised any
voice of mercy, and they suffered the imputation of
mercenary motives for their clemency.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jerusalem was given over to the Christian spoilers.
Every man secured possession of the dwelling upon
which he first set his mark or name. To Tancred’s
share fell the entire furniture of the mosque of Omar,
six chariot-loads of gold and silver candelabra and
other ornaments. With characteristic generosity, he
divided the booty with Godfrey and many private
soldiers, reserving fifty marks of gold for the redecoration
of the Christian churches. But most
precious to their credulity was the True Cross, alleged
to have been miraculously discovered by Helena, the
mother of Constantine, in the fourth century, which,
having been stolen by Chosroes the Persian, had
been restored to the sacred city by Heraclius.</p>

  <h3 id='chap19' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='nineteen'>XIX.</abbr> <br> GODFREY, FIRST BARON OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE—CONQUEST OF THE LAND—THE KINGDOM OF JERUSALEM.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>When wearied with gathering the spoil the
crusaders deliberated how best to secure
their possessions. This could be done
only by maintaining peace within the city
and adequate defence against the armies
of the Infidels, who would undoubtedly rise to assail
them from without.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their first business was the selection of a king of
Jerusalem. The popularity of Godfrey, merited by
his genius, bravery, and devotion, readily suggested
his name to the ten electors who were chosen to
voice the suffrage of the host. To secure his enthusiastic
reception by the people, he did not need additional
arguments drawn from imagined revelations
of the will of Heaven. Yet visions were invoked to
confirm the judgment of human discretion. One reported
that he had seen Godfrey enthroned in the
sun, while numberless flocks of birds from all lands
came and nestled at his feet. This was interpreted
to mean the coming glory of Jerusalem and the crowds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>of pilgrims who should be safe beneath his sway.
Godfrey modestly declined the royal title, accepting
only that of Defender and Baron of the Holy Sepulchre,
saying that he would not wear a crown of gold
in the city where Christ had worn only a crown of
thorns (July 22, 1099).</p>

<p class='c007'>With less unanimity and only after unseemly
brawls, which were in strange contrast with the orderly
arrangement of their secular affairs, Arnold de
Rohes, the eloquent but dissolute ecclesiastic, was
selected by the priests as Patriarch of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c007'>With true statesmanlike purpose, Godfrey addressed
himself to the organization of the political
and military government of his new dominion. He
had, however, little time to devote to the peaceful
progress of his kingdom. Raymond diverted his
chief’s attention more by plots of ambition and
jealousy than he aided him by wisdom of counsel.
Multitudes of Christians resident in the East, excited
to become such by the fame of the conquests of the
crusaders, poured into the city and vicinage, and thus
added to the governor’s cares.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time the Mussulmans, quickly recuperating
from their despair, inaugurated new campaigns.
The Turks and Persians laid aside their jealousy of
the Egyptians, and poured southward and westward
to join the army of the caliph of Cairo. Afdhal,
already famous for having wrested Jerusalem from
the Turks, gathered the warriors of Islam of all tribes
and races, from the Nile to the Tigris. His advancing
army was supported by a vast fleet, which had
been laden at Alexandria and Damietta with provisions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>and siege apparatus for a second capture of what
to them, as well as to the Christians, was the sacred
city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Learning that the Moslems had reached Gaza,
Godfrey set forth to meet them, with Tancred as his
most worthy coadjutant. Raymond, having quarrelled
with Godfrey about the independent possession
of the tower of David, sulked in his house, and
Robert of Normandy also refused to march to the aid
of Godfrey. These leaders were, however, at length
driven from the city by the taunts of the priests and
the women. Their martial pride was also stirred by the
message of Godfrey that a battle was imminent. The
crusaders made their camp at Ramleh, and August
<abbr title='eleventh'>11th</abbr> advanced towards Ascalon. By the banks of the
wadi Surak they captured immense herds of camels,
oxen, and sheep, which encouraged them as much,
doubtless, as did the wood of the True Cross that was
carried through the ranks. The herds also seemed
to be marshalled by a special providence as their
rearward. We must describe this in the words of
Godfrey: “When we advanced to battle, wonderful
to relate, the camels formed in many squadrons, and
the sheep and oxen did the same. Moreover, these
animals accompanied us, halting when we halted,
advancing when we advanced, and charging when
we charged.” The enormous dust-clouds raised by
the herds led the Moslems to take them for a contingent
of the Christian force, which imagination
magnified to many times its real numbers. A paralysis
of fear fell upon the Infidels. Most of them, being
fresh troops, had never met the crusaders in battle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>and had dared the issue, relying upon their own
superiority in numbers. Now that this dependence
seemingly failed them, they anticipated defeat at the
hands of the heroes of Nicæa and Antioch and Jerusalem,
and stood nerveless before the attack. The
Christians, coming near, fell every man upon his
knees in prayer, then rose to make the charge. Raymond
struck the column of Turks and Persians;
Tancred led his braves through the Moors and Egyptians;
Godfrey crushed the Ethiopians, who resisted
him but for an instant with their long flails armed
with balls of iron; Robert of Normandy wrested the
standard from the hands of Afdhal himself. As the
Moslems cast away their bows and javelins to hasten
their flight, the Christians cast away theirs that they
might speed the pursuit with the sword. Back they
drove the Infidels against the walls of Ascalon. Two
thousand were trampled or suffocated in the crowd
that choked the gate; multitudes, avoiding the city,
were driven into the sea and were drowned. The
panic communicated itself to the Egyptian sailors on
the fleet, who spread their sails and disappeared over
the sea, leaving the Moslem soldiers no opportunity
of escape. Godfrey says: “There were not in our
army more than five thousand horsemen and fifteen
thousand foot-soldiers, and there were probably of
the enemy one hundred thousand horsemen and four
hundred thousand foot-soldiers.... More than one
hundred thousand perished by the sword; and if
many of ours had not been detained plundering the
camp, few of the great multitude would have escaped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Raymond claimed the city of Ascalon for his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>possession. Godfrey declared that all conquests
belonged to their common kingdom of Jerusalem.
Raymond, in mean revenge, encouraged the Moslems
not to surrender their stronghold, which still resisted.
By similar counsel he prevailed upon the Saracen
garrison of Arsuf to hold out. Godfrey could not
restrain his anger at this treachery, and turned his
arms upon his old comrade. Tancred and Robert of
Normandy threw themselves between the swords of
the combatants and effected their reconciliation.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the victory at Ascalon (August 19, 1099) the
first crusade may be said to have terminated. The
events of the subsequent year relate to the history of
the new kingdom of Jerusalem. The closing months
of the eleventh century witnessed the return of the
mass of crusaders to their European homes. In almost
every castle and hamlet of France the thrilling
events of three years were narrated by those whose
scars corroborated the story of their valor and sufferings.
Nearly every family remembered a father,
a brother, or a son as a martyr, or rejoiced in his return
renowned as a hero or revered as a saint.</p>

<p class='c007'>Few of the leaders enlarged their repute by any
subsequent actions. Peter the Hermit ended his
days at advanced age in the monastery of Huy, which
his renown for sanctity had enabled him to found.
Robert of Normandy seems to have exhausted all the
manliness of his nature in his Eastern adventures.
He allowed an amour to detain him in Italy for more
than a year, during which time his brother Henry
took the throne of England on the death of William
Rufus, a reward which might easily have come to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Robert, had he shown disposition to defend his right
of inheritance. Henry wrested from him even his
duchy of Normandy, and confined him in the castle
of Cardiff, where he died after twenty-eight years of
captivity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Raymond retired to Laodicea, the government of
which he had secured. From this place he was summoned
to command new bands of crusaders. Multitudes
set out under him. Some followed Stephen of
Blois, brother to the French king, whose desertion of
the crusaders brought upon him such dishonor that
he was eager to restore his repute by a second enlistment.
William, Count of Poitiers, Lord of France,
reputed as the first of the Troubadours, departed
with a retinue of soldiers and girls. A German horde
was led by Conrad, the marshal of the empire. Italians
followed Anselm, Archbishop of Milan, in whose train
were lords, knights, and noble ladies, among them the
Princess Ida of Austria.</p>

<p class='c007'>These various bands, like the earlier crusaders, met
at Constantinople, repeating the annoyance to the
Emperor Alexius, who begged Raymond to relieve
him of their presence. This veteran accepted the
duty, bearing with him the Holy Lance that had
wrought wonders at Antioch, and which Raymond
regarded as a match for the arm of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ambrose that
the Archbishop of Milan had brought from his cathedral.</p>

<p class='c007'>This march eastward was without discipline, monks
and women often filling the places of soldiers. Kilidge-Arslan,
the Sultan of Iconium, burned with desire to
avenge his defeat three years before at Nicæa. Kerbogha,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Sultan of Mosul, was equally inflamed to
wipe out his disgrace at Antioch. These joined their
forces and overwhelmed the Christians at the river
Halys. The massacre almost amounted to extermination.
Raymond fled with the other leaders. The
Turks repeated their assault upon a second army,
under the Count de Nevers, at Ancyra, with similar
results. And again they administered their terrible
vengeance upon a third army, under the Count of
Poitiers, the Duke of Bavaria, and Count Hugh of
Vermandois, of whose reputed one hundred and fifty
thousand scarcely one thousand escaped. The leaders
found a sorry refuge in rags and wounds at Tarsus
and Antioch. The women, among them the Princess
Ida, disappeared within the curtains of numberless
harems. A forlorn remnant reached Jerusalem, to
add, perhaps, more to the care than to the assistance
of Godfrey.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rule of Godfrey as Baron of the Holy Sepulchre
was brief, but such as to promise, had his career been
extended to even the age of most of his companions,
a record worthy of the greatest of kings. Despising
the mere gilding of a throne, he sought to strengthen
his government by the best laws known to Europe,
as well as to guard and extend his power by the
sword.</p>

<p class='c007'>The latter was, however, the first and pressing
necessity. The departure of the crusading hosts left
him but three hundred knights with their retainers,
out of six hundred thousand who during three years
had taken the cross. His strongholds were, besides
Jerusalem, a score of towns scattered over the vicinage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>of the capital, in many cases antagonized by the
still remaining fortresses of the Infidels. The country
between these towns was open to the passage of his
foes. The land was untilled, and offered scanty provision
for his people. To prevent a further exodus
of Christians, it was enacted that land could be acquired
in ownership only after a year’s continuous
occupancy, and would be alienated by a year’s absence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tancred was as Godfrey’s right hand. These two
men stand out together as preëminent for their moral
qualities among many as brave as they in merely
physical prowess. To Tancred was assigned the
principality of Tiberias, the possession of which he
quickly acquired with his sword. Godfrey at the
same time forced the acknowledgment of his government
by exacting tribute from the Arabs west of the
Jordan, and from the emirs along the coast of the
Mediterranean. One city, Asur (Arsuf), refused submission
and maintained its independence in spite of
siege. The spirit of Godfrey was strangely tried here
by an incident. Gerard of Avernes had been given up
by Godfrey as a hostage for his clemency and justice
in dealing with the people of the town. While the
arrows of the Christians were sweeping the walls,
Gerard was placed unshielded at a point where they
were falling thickest, that his danger might divert the
assault. Godfrey, coming near, cried aloud to him,
“If my own brother were in your place I could not
cease my attack; die, then, as a brave knight.”
Gerard accepted his martyrdom, and fell beneath the
missiles of his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>To Jerusalem came a multitude of pilgrims, among
them Dagobert (Daimbert) as special legate from the
Pope. By virtue of his high office he claimed for
himself the patriarchate of Jerusalem, together with
the secular sovereignty of Jaffa and the section of the
sacred city in which was located the Holy Sepulchre.
Following further the policy of the popes to make
their dominion a world monarchy, secular as well as
spiritual, Dagobert required Godfrey to acknowledge
himself a temporal vassal of the pontiff, and to pledge
to the patriarch the sovereignty of the kingdom in the
event of Godfrey dying without children. Bohemond,
as Prince of Antioch, and Baldwin, Prince of
Edessa, brother of Godfrey, and Raymond, now of
Laodicea, were at the time visiting Jerusalem. These
also made their submission, and received their governments
anew from the Holy Father.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the counsel of these and others, his wisest
advisers, Godfrey inaugurated the system of laws
afterwards known as the Assizes of Jerusalem. They
were not completed until a subsequent century, but
their inception belongs to his statesmanship. These
regulations are interesting as reflecting in brief compass
the best customs of Europe. Their study may,
therefore, be on that wider field. The Assizes were
a sort of written constitution, and when prepared the
original document was placed with solemn pomp in
the archives of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the reign begun under such favorable auspices
was suddenly terminated. Returning from an expedition
for the succor of Tancred, Godfrey accepted
the hospitality of the emir of Cæsarea, and immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>falling ill, his sickness was accredited to poisoned
fruit. He died soon after reaching his capital (June
18, 1100), at the early age of thirty-eight. In the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre is still to be seen his
tomb, near by that of his Lord, which he had given
his brief but brave life to rescue and defend.</p>

<p class='c007'>Godfrey’s preëminence among the original crusader
chieftains was due not so much to any single virtue
in which he was their superior as to a rare combination
of many excellent qualities. It was said of him
that he was the peer of Raymond in counsel and of
Tancred in the field. To this we may add that for
piety he outshone Adhemar the priest. In the midst
of the fight he would pause for prayer to the God of
battles; and his meditation on sacred themes was
ordinarily prolonged far beyond the hours prescribed
for devotion by the church. His nature was gentler
and more just than that of his companions. If at times
his actions were cruel, they might be attributed rather
to the habit of the age than to his own inclination.
Since he surpassed his generation in so many respects,
it would be neither just nor generous to criticise his
defects. In him we see the budding of a better type
of humanity amid the prevailing grossness of animalism
and superstition.</p>

  <h3 id='chap20' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty'>XX.</abbr> <br> BALDWIN <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr>, KING OF JERUSALEM.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In strange contrast with Godfrey was his
brother Baldwin, the Prince of Edessa,
whom the necessities of the infant kingdom,
rather than his own merits, now
called to the vacant throne. Baldwin had
already shown himself as unscrupulous as he was
alert, and as covetous as he was bold. With undoubted
adroitness and courage, he had acquired and
held his principality of Edessa. Here he reigned with
Oriental pomp, wore long robes and flowing beard,
sat cross-legged on rugs, and compelled all suppliants
for his favor to approach with the salaam of profoundest
homage. This ostentation was apparently more
from policy among a people familiar with such customs
than from love of display or any despotic instinct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dagobert, the papal legate, opposed the suggestion
of Baldwin’s kingship of Jerusalem, and claimed that
honor for himself. He might have obtained it had
not Garnier, the agent of Baldwin, seized upon the
tower of David and the other fortresses in the name
of his absent master. The baffled prelate called upon
Bohemond, now Prince of Antioch, to come and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>avenge this insult offered to the Holy Father in the
person of his legate; but the Turks, by capturing
Bohemond, interfered with this plan. The activity
shown by the common enemy decided the popular
voice for Baldwin as king. The dangers which
threatened forbade that the government of Jerusalem
should be left in the hands of a priest untrained in
war. The soldier seemed pointed out by Providence
for the kingship, although the hand of the Pope was
stretched out to anoint another.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baldwin, learning of the death of Godfrey, immediately
turned over the government of Edessa to
his cousin, Baldwin du Bourg, and with fourteen hundred
men marched for Jerusalem. On the way he
gave new proof of his puissance by first outwitting
and then utterly routing vastly superior numbers, with
which the emirs of Damascus and Emesa endeavored
to block his way. Pausing at the sacred city only
long enough to assure himself of the applause of the
entire population, he gave another exhibition of his
merit of the crown before wearing it. With a sudden
swoop he devastated the enemy’s country from the
Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, and, laden with
booty, demanded and received from the hands of the
unwilling prelate the crown and blessing in the name
of the Pope. Quickly following the coronation services
at Bethlehem, he captured Arsuf and Cæsarea.
An Egyptian army had advanced as far as Ramleh,
but Baldwin, with a white kerchief tied to his lance’s
point as his oriflamme, led his braves again and again
through this host, until they were routed, leaving five
thousand dead on the field. Amid the shrieks of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>dying the king caught the subdued cry of a woman.
She was the wife of a Moslem, who had accompanied
her husband to the war, and had been taken with
the pains of childbirth. By the conqueror’s order
she was tenderly cared for, placed upon the rug from
his own tent, covered with his own mantle, and
later conducted with her new-born babe to the arms
of her husband. His compassion soon received its
reward. The rallying Mussulmans surrounded his
band not only with swords, but with fire, having
ignited the long, dried grass. With difficulty the king
escaped to Ramleh, which the enemy completely
invested. During the night, while anticipating the
fateful assault of the morrow, he was secretly approached
by a Moslem officer. This man proved to
be the husband of the woman whom Baldwin had
befriended. Led by his gratitude, he had put his
own life in jeopardy in order to reveal to his benefactor
a secret path to safety. The Moslem assault
carried the town; they put to death all Christians
found within it. In Jerusalem the great bell tolled,
while the people crowded the churches or marched
in procession, mourning the supposed death of their
king, when suddenly came the news of Baldwin’s
safety. In the rhetoric of the chronicle, it was “like
the morning star out of the night’s blackness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The capture of Ramleh by the enemy endangered
Jaffa, the real port of Jerusalem, at which the kingdom
was in touch with Europe. Baldwin made his way
in disguise to Arsuf. Embarking with Godric, an
English pirate, he sailed straight through the Egyptian
galleys that guarded the harbor of Jaffa. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>June, 1102, with forces augmented from an English
fleet under Harding, he assailed the enemy. The
Patriarch of Jerusalem carried the wood of the True
Cross. With the cry, “Christus regnat! Vincet!
Imperat!” which subsequently appeared as the legend
on the gold coins of France, the besieged became the
victors. But the joy of the triumph when the king
returned to Jerusalem was marred by the memory of
the many slain; Stephen of Blois and Stephen of
Burgundy, with a great number of the bravest knights,
had fallen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greek emperor, Alexius, while sending congratulation
to the Christians, could not repress his
jealousy of their victories. He prepared to assail
Antioch; he negotiated with the captors of Bohemond
for his ransom, that he might secure from his gratitude
the title to the city which that chieftain held.
Bohemond, however, ransomed himself by pledges to
the emir who held him, and, after having endured a
captivity of four years, defended his city in battles
by sea and land from the treachery of the Greeks.
At the same time, with other chieftains, he carried
arms into Mesopotamia. At Charan he barely escaped
in company with Tancred, while their companions,
Josselin de Courtenay and Baldwin du
Bourg, were dungeoned at Mosul.</p>

<p class='c007'>In view of his exhausted resources, Bohemond attempted
a vast and romantic scheme for their recuperation.
Having floated a report of his death, he
concealed himself in a coffin and passed through the
watchful fleet of the Greeks, who cursed his imagined
corpse. Arriving in Italy, he secured a new commission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>from the Pope. In France he so ingratiated
himself with King Philip <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr> as to secure that monarch’s
daughter, the Princess Constance, to wife. He then
raised a new army of crusaders. In Spain and Italy
he augmented this force, and embarking at Bari, he
attempted to take a bitter retaliation on the empire
of the Greeks. His expedition against Durazzo failed
of success. Bohemond, at the moment when his
ambition was at the point of its extremest satisfaction,
returned to die in his own Italian dominion of Taranto.</p>

<p class='c007'>The kingdom of Jerusalem was reduced to all sorts
of expedients to raise the means of its support and
extension. King Baldwin recouped his treasury by
marriage with Adela, widow of Count Roger of Sicily.
Her vast wealth was heralded by the vessel in which
she sailed, whose mast was incased in gold and whose
hold was laden with gems and coin. A thousand
trained warriors followed, at her expense. Either
the drain upon her purse or the incompatibility of
her relations with the king led her to leave him after
three years and return to Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the assistance of Genoese fleets, Ptolemaïs
was captured. The mutual jealousies between the
Turks and the Egyptians enabled the Christians to
secure the southern coast of Palestine. Raymond
having died before the walls of Tripoli, his son Bertrand
captured that city, which from that time became
the titular possession of his family. An immense
library of Persian, Arabic, and Egyptian manuscripts
was by the illiterate Christians given to the flames.
Biblus and Beirut also fell before the standard of
the cross. With the aid of a fleet and ten thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>men, under Sigur of Norway, Sidon was quickly
acquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the midst of these triumphs came an irreparable
loss. Tancred, the ideal of knighthood, died
(December 12, 1112). His genius and sword had
conquered widely in northern Syria. His memory
has been embalmed, while his real virtues, which
needed no untruthful praises, have been exaggerated
in poetry and romance since Chaucer sang of him
as “a very parfite, gentil knight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The loss of Tancred was felt especially in the north,
where the Christians soon after met a fearful defeat
at Mount Tabor. In extremity they made alliance
with the Saracens of Damascus and Mesopotamia,
under the Sultan of Bagdad.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jealousy among the Moslems giving him
seeming security from attack on the north, King
Baldwin planned the invasion of Egypt. He crossed
the desert and appeared within three days’ journey
of Cairo. While returning from a raid, laden with
spoil and flushed with the anticipation of soon adding
the land of the Nile to his possessions, the king fell
sick. Nominating Baldwin du Bourg for his successor,
he died at the edge of the desert (1118). His body
was brought, in obedience to his dying request, and
deposited beside that of Godfrey, near to the Holy
Sepulchre.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>Baldwin du Bourg was elected to
the vacant throne of Jerusalem, Eustace,
brother of Godfrey, having declined to
contest it, magnanimously saying to his
partisans, “Not by me shall a stumbling-block
enter into the Lord’s kingdom.” Baldwin <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>
was well advanced in years, experienced in council
and in field, having been one of the companions of
Godfrey in the first crusade, and during the reign
of Baldwin <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr> having held the government of Edessa.
In contrast with his predecessor, he was painstaking
in planning, cautious in executing, and withal a man
of deep religious devotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In April, 1123, while attempting the relief of Count
Josselin, who had been taken prisoner at Khartpert
by Balek the Turkoman, King Baldwin <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> was captured
and confined in the same city. A devoted band
of Armenians entered Khartpert in the disguise of
merchants, and succeeded in liberating Josselin, but
the king was carried away to Harran for safer keeping.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>The absence of Baldwin <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> was measurably compensated
by the vigor and astuteness of Eustace
Grenier, who was elected to the regency. The
Egyptians had massed themselves in the plains of
Ascalon for an advance against Jerusalem. After a
fast, which was so rigorously enforced that mothers
did not suckle their babes, and cattle were driven to
sterile places beyond their pasturage, the army of
Christians marched from the city at the sound of the
great bell. The patriarch carried the wood of the
True Cross, another dignitary bore the Holy Lance,
another a vase containing milk from the breast of the
Virgin Mary. The credulity which devised these expedients
of victory might readily see, as reported, a
celestial thunderbolt fall upon the army of the Infidels.
It is enough for history to record that the Christians
were triumphant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Genoese and Pisans had often brought assistance
to the crusaders and great gain to themselves
by the part they took in these holy wars. The
Venetians, however, having profitable commerce with
the Saracens, were not at first tempted to hazard a
rupture with them. At length they too sought the
new adventure. In the warlike temper of the age,
the Venetian fleet, in command of the doge, Domenicho
Michaeli, did not hesitate to attack a returning
Genoese fleet for the sake of its plunder. Having
robbed and murdered their coreligionists, they repeated
the raid upon an Egyptian fleet which was
leaving the mouth of the Nile. With appetites thus
whetted, they proposed to the regency at Jerusalem
to sell themselves to the service of God for one third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the territory they might acquire conjointly with the
crusaders. The terms being accepted, an innocent
child drew the lot which should show the will of
Heaven as to whether Ascalon or Tyre were the better
prize. Tyre was indicated, and six months after
(July 7, 1124) fell to gratify the greed of Venice and
the pride of the people of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c007'>A month later King Baldwin <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> secured his liberation.
In 1129 he strengthened his throne by the
marriage of his daughter, Melisende, to Foulque of
Anjou, son of the notorious Bertrade, who had deserted
her legitimate husband for the embrace of
King Philip of France. This monarch had put away
his wife Bertha for this new union. Thus was brought
upon Philip the famous excommunication of the Pope.
Two years later (August 13, 1131) Baldwin <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> died
and was buried with Godfrey and Baldwin <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr> in the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p class='c007'>Foulque ascended the throne. His first work was
to settle a dispute for the lordship of Antioch, which
was accomplished only after bloodshed between
brethren. Next he baffled the Greek emperor, John
Comnenus, who attempted to gain for himself the
kingdom of Jerusalem. Later he made alliance with
the Mussulman Prince of Damascus and fought against
Zenghi, Prince of Mosul. His queen, Melisende,
by her rumored amours brought him additional perplexity.
King Foulque died from an injury while
hunting (November 13, 1143), leaving two children,
Baldwin and Amalric.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baldwin <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> succeeded his father at the age of
thirteen, with Melisende as regent. Effeminacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>not only marked the government, but infected the
spirit of the people. The heroism of the founders of
the kingdom seemed to die in the blood of their successors,
or, if danger fired the ancient valor, it was
without the light of discretion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Baldwin <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> inaugurated his reign by a
foolish expedition to take Bozrah, which had been
offered in surrender by its traitorous commandant.
To accomplish this it was necessary to break a fair
and useful alliance which the Christians had made
with the Sultan of Damascus, the rightful lord of
Bozrah. On reaching Bozrah, instead of the keys of
the city, there was placed in the hands of the king an
announcement from the wife of the treacherous governor
that she herself would defend the walls. The
perplexity of the king and his equally callow advisers
was followed by an ignoble retreat. The enemy
pursued not only with sword, but with fire. The
wind, which seemed to the retreating army to be the
breath of God’s wrath, covered them with smoke and
cinders, while the flames of the burning grass chased
their fleeing feet. The Christians would have perished
had not, say the chronicles, the wood of the
True Cross, raised with prayer, changed the direction
of the breeze and beaten back the pursuers.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time there was felt the need of an astute
mind at the head of the kingdom. Christian progress
had been arrested, and events of evil omen were thickening.</p>

<p class='c007'>The star of Zenghi, the ruler of Mosul, the father
of Nourredin, and the forerunner of Saladin, had
arisen. This redoubtable warrior had conquered all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>his Moslem rivals on the Euphrates; he had swept
with resistless fury westward, capturing Aleppo
(1128), Hamah (1129), and Athareb (1130). Though
the Moslems had been assisted by Baldwin <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, yet
the Oriental writers sang of how the “swords of Allah
found their scabbards in the neck of His foes.” In
1144, one year from young Baldwin’s coronation,
Zenghi appeared before the walls of Edessa, which
since the early days of the crusades had been in the
possession of the Christians. This city was the bulwark
of the Christian kingdom in the East; it is thus
described in the florid language of the place and
time: “I was as a queen in the midst of her court;
sixty towns standing around me formed my train;
my altars, loaded with treasure, shed their splendor
afar and appeared to be the abode of angels. I surpassed
in magnificence the proudest cities of Asia,
and I was as a celestial ornament raised upon the
bosom of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Had old Josselin de Courtenay been living, Edessa
would have given a stubborn and possibly a successful
defence, for the terror of his name had long held
the Moslems at bay. Once, while lying on what he
thought to be his death-bed, this veteran heard that
the enemy had laid siege to one of his strong towers,
and commanded his son to go to its rescue. The
younger Josselin delayed on account of the few troops
he could take with him. Old Josselin ordered the
soldiers to carry him to the front on his litter. The
news of his approach was sufficient to cause the quick
withdrawal of the Moslems; but an invincible foe was
upon the warrior, for, with hand raised in gratitude
to Heaven, he expired.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Josselin <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> of Edessa was unworthy of such a sire.
His weakness being known, he inspired neither terror
in his foes nor respect among his own people. Zenghi
surprised Edessa with a host of Kurds and Turkomans.
To Oriental daring he added the careful engineering
learned from his Western antagonists. Quickly the
walls were surrounded by movable towers higher than
the ramparts; battering-rams beat against the foundation,
and storms of stones, javelins, and combustibles
swept away the defenders. In vain the city held out
for a while in expectancy of aid from Jerusalem. On
the twenty-eighth day (December 14, 1144) it fell.
The news spread a dismay which could have been
surpassed only by the capture of Jerusalem itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The report of Zenghi’s death two years later gave
to the Christians a ray of hope for at least fewer
disasters. That hope was quickly extinguished by
the exploits of Nourredin, his son, whose deeds stirred
the prophetic spirit of Moslem imams to foretell the
speedy fall of the Holy City. At the same time they
excited the superstitious fears of the Christians, who
saw in comets, as well as in the flash of Nourredin’s
cimeters, the signs of Heaven’s displeasure, and interpreted
the very thunders of the sky as the celestial
echo of his tramping squadrons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tidings of the fall of Edessa was the immediate
occasion of the second crusade.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before considering this, let us note briefly the influence
upon Europe of the first crusade and of the
kingdom of Jerusalem which it had established.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>
  <h3 id='chap22' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-two'>XXII.</abbr> <br> MILITARY ORDERS—HOSPITALLERS—TEMPLARS—TEUTONIC KNIGHTS.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>One of the most significant fruits of the
first crusade was the creation and growth
of the military orders—the Hospitallers,
or Knights of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John, the Templars, and
the Teutonic Knights.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Hospitallers, or Knights of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John.</i>—This
famous organization, which was for centuries a bulwark
of Christendom and which still exists, originated
earlier than the crusades, but first attained power
and repute in those exciting days. In the year 1023
the Egyptian caliph, who held possession of Jerusalem,
was induced by the entreaty of the merchants
of Amalfi to allow them to found in the sacred
city a hospital for the care of poor and sick Latin
pilgrims. A building near the Holy Sepulchre was
secured for the purpose and dedicated to the Virgin,
with the title of “Santa Maria de Latina.” As the
multitude of pilgrims and their needs increased, a
more commodious hospitium was erected. This was
named after the sainted Patriarch of Alexandria,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>John Eleemon (the Compassionate). <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John the
Baptist seems, however, to have secured the honor
of becoming the ultimate titular patron of this order
of nurses and almoners. When Jerusalem fell into
the possession of the crusaders in 1099, Gerard, the
hospital Master, endeared himself and his little band
of helpers to the multitude of wounded. Godfrey de
Bouillon endowed them with the revenues of his
estates in Brabant. His example was followed by
others. Many with spirits chastened by their own
sufferings gave themselves personally to the work of
the Hospitallers. Gerard, the Master, organized the
brethren into a religious order, exacting from them
the triple vow of poverty, obedience, and chastity.
Each member wore a black robe, and upon his breast
an eight-pointed white cross. Anticipating our history,
in 1113 the order was dignified by the special
sanction of Pope Paschal <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> Raymond du Puy, a
noble knight of Dauphine, became Master in 1118,
and enlarged the function of members by requiring
of them, in addition to the triple vow, an oath of military
service. The order was then divided into (1)
knights, whose special work was in the camp and
field; (2) clergy; (3) serving brethren, or hospital
attendants. Later it was necessary to subdivide its
numerous adherents into seven classes, according to
the language they spoke. The order was a republic,
whose officers were elected by the suffrage of all,
but who, once installed, wielded an autocratic power.
Its fame spread throughout all countries. Multitudes
enlisted under its auspices for service in the Holy
Land; it became possessed of enormous property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>throughout Europe; its agents were at all courts, and
its Briarean hands were felt at every centre of power
throughout Christendom.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Templars.</i>—In the year 1114, four years before
the Hospitallers had enlarged their function to
include military duties, a Burgundian knight, Hugh
de Payen, and eight comrades bound themselves by
oath to guard the public roads about Jerusalem,
which were continually menaced by Moslems and
freebooters. King Baldwin <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> assigned these good
men quarters on the temple site of Mount Moriah,
whence their title, “Pauperes Commilitones Christi
Templique Salomonici.” At first the Templars seem
to have gloried in their poverty, as indicated by the
original seal of the order, which represents two knights
mounted on a single horse. Their members augmented
until they shared with the Hospitallers the
glory of being the chief defenders of the new kingdom
of Jerusalem. Hugh de Payen was sent by
Baldwin <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> as one of his ambassadors to secure help
from European powers. The Grand Master, appearing
before the Council of Noyes, January, 1128,
obtained for his order the formal approval of the
church. He returned to Palestine with three hundred
knights, representing the noblest families of Europe.
Among them was Foulque of Anjou, afterwards the
King of Jerusalem. Brotherhoods of Templars were
founded in Spain by 1129, in France by 1131, and
in Rome by 1138. The mantle of the Knight Templar
was white with a plain red cross on the left breast.
The clerical members wore black. Their banner bore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the inscription, “Not unto us, O Lord, but unto Thy
name be glory!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of the Hospitallers and the Templars
until the fall of the sacred city is that of the kingdom
itself. In all battles these knights of the white and the
red cross were conspicuous for bravery, and by the
unity and discipline of their organizations gave steadiness
to the progress of the cause, or at least retarded
other disasters which finally befell it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Teutonic Order.</i>—The Order of Teutonic Knights
of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mary’s Hospital at Jerusalem was founded in
1128. During its earlier history its members limited
their endeavors to religious and charitable work. It
was not until 1190, during a later crusade than that
we have been narrating, that it acquired military
organization. From that time, as a purely German
order, it shared with the Hospitallers and Templars
the charters bestowed by the Pope and emperors,
and contested with them the palm of heroism and
power. Its peculiar badge was a black cross on a
white mantle.</p>

  <h3 id='chap23' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-three'>XXIII.</abbr> <br> EUROPE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND CRUSADES—KINGSHIP IN FRANCE—PAPAL AGGRANDIZEMENT—ABÉLARD—ARNOLD OF BRESCIA—BERNARD.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>During the fifty years (1096-1146) which
had elapsed since the exodus of the first
crusaders a new generation had grown up
in Europe. Vast changes had taken place
everywhere, in every grade of society, in
popular habits, and in conditions of thought. The
crisis of the Dark Ages had passed; new light was
breaking upon problems of government, the relation
of classes, and even upon religious doctrine and
discipline. These changes were largely due to the
crusade itself and to the continuous intercourse between
the East and the West which it inaugurated.
The full development of these new sentiments and
movements was due to the influence of subsequent
crusades. We may, therefore, reserve their consideration
until we shall have completed the story of
these various expeditions, the tramp of which was yet
to resound for a hundred and fifty years. Two results
were, however, so intimately connected with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>close of the first and the projection of the second crusade
as to call for notice in passing. These were the
strengthening of the kingship in France and the increased
prestige of the Papacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The kingship in France during this period became
consolidated and rapidly advanced. So many of the
more potent and adventurous barons being engaged
in foreign parts, the crown had little competition, and
feudal privileges were steadily merged in the royal
prerogatives. In the words of Michelet, “Ponderous
feudalism had begun to move, and to uproot itself from
the soil. It went and came, and lived upon the beaten
highway of the crusade between France and Jerusalem.”
France under Louis <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr> (the Fat) (1108-37)
became a nation, and was less jealous of restless
chieftains at home than of the newly risen kingdom
of the Normans in England, the long rivalry with
which may be dated from this reign. When the
German emperor, Henry <abbr title='the fifth'>V.</abbr>, in 1124 prepared to invade
France, the counts of Flanders, Brittany, Aquitaine,
and Anjou rallied against him under the lead
of the French king, whose authority they had previously
menaced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gathering of the forces of the Frankish peoples
under a single sceptre marks a new era in the
history of Europe. We shall observe especially its
influence upon the organization of the coming crusades,
whose leaders were no longer feudal chieftains,
like Godfrey, Raymond, Bohemond, and Tancred, but
royal personages supported by the compact power of
the new nationality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief advantage from the first crusade fell to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the Papacy, which gathered to itself the prestige of
the power it had evoked; and rightly, if great prevision
ever merits the fruit of the policy it dares to
inaugurate. Paschal <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, who followed Urban <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> in
the papal chair (1099-1118), was too weak to uphold
the daring projects of his predecessor; but Calixtus
<abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> (1119-24) and Innocent <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> (1130-43) showed
the genuine Hildebrandian spirit. Although the
Concordat of Worms (1123) modified somewhat the
claims of the Papacy as against the German empire,
the church steadily compacted its power about thrones
and people.</p>

<p class='c007'>The authority of the Papacy was especially augmented
in this period by its temporary success against
a movement whose ultimate triumph was destined to
cost the Roman Church its dominance of Christendom,
viz., the impulse towards liberal thought. The
standard-bearer of this essential Protestantism was
Abélard. This astute reasoner placed the human
judgment, when guided by correct scholarship, above
all traditional authority. The popularity of his
teaching was a serious menace to the doctrines of
the church, so far as these rested upon the dictation
of the popes. The consternation of ecclesiastics was
voiced by Bernard, the Abbot of Clairvaux, who
declared in his appeal to Pope Innocent <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>: “These
books of Abélard are flying abroad over all the world;
they no longer shun the light; they find their way
into castles and cities; they pass from land to land,
from one people to another. A new gospel is promulgated,
a new faith is preached. Disputations are
held on virtue and vice not according to Christian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>morality, on the sacraments of the church not according
to the rule of faith, on the mystery of the
Trinity not with simplicity and soberness. This huge
Goliath, with his armor-bearer, Arnold of Brescia,
defies the armies of the Lord to battle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Goliath fell, but by no pebble from the sling
of a David. Bernard was justly reputed the greatest
mind of the age. He hesitated to enter into a learned
controversy with Abélard, but smote him with a
thunderbolt of excommunication, which he secured
from the hands of the occupant of the Vatican throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another movement against the papal power was
even more threatening and, during the period we
are describing, caused the throne of Peter to tremble.
As Abélard assailed the current thought, so Arnold
of Brescia proposed to revolutionize the secular power
of the Papacy. He denied its right to temporal
dominion in Italy, to dominate as it was doing the
councils of other kingdoms, to interfere with judicial
functions or to conduct military operations. He
would sweep away all this outward estate as unbecoming
the representative of Jesus of Nazareth. The
clergy must be reduced to apostolic poverty; their
glory should be only their good works; their maintenance
the voluntary offerings, or at most the tithings,
of the people. Even the empire of Germany and the
French kingdom should be converted into republics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arnold’s views made rapid headway. Brescia
declared itself a republic. The Swiss valleys were
full of liberal sympathizers. A commonwealth sprang
up in Rome, which announced to the Pope its recognition
of only his spiritual headship. The people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>defeated and slew one Pope, who was clad in armor
and marched at the head of his soldiers; another
they expelled.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was while the papal territory in Italy was thus
occupied by the adherents of Arnold that the second
crusade was inaugurated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux, was its chief inspirer,
both in counsel with the leaders of Europe and with
his voice as its popular herald. High above generals
and scholars, beyond kings, emperors, and popes, this
man stands in the gaze of history. His repute for
wisdom and sanctity was extended by miracles accredited
to his converse with Heaven. Believed to
be above earthly ambition, he commanded and rebuked
with a celestial authority. Papal electors came
to consult the monk before they announced their
judgment as to who should be Pope, and when on
the throne the Pope consulted the monk before he
ventured to set the seal of his infallibility to his own
utterances. Bernard’s humility may have been great
Godward, but it was not of the sort to lead him to
decline the solemn sovereignty of men’s minds and
wills. When Henry <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr> of England hesitated to acknowledge
Innocent <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, Bernard’s choice for Pope,
on the ground that he was not the rightful occupant
of the holy see, the monk exclaimed, “Answer thou
for thy other sins; let this be on my head.” When
Lothaire of Germany demanded of the Holy Father
the renewal of the right of imperial investitures, the
saint threw his spell about the emperor and left him
submissive at the feet of the pontiff. When Louis
<abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr> of France, in his rage against Thibaut, Count
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>of Champagne, carried devastation through the
count’s domains and burned the church of Vitry,
with thirteen hundred of its citizens who had there
taken refuge against his vengeance, Bernard openly
rebuked the king, and with such effect that the
monarch proposed, as a self-inflicted penance, a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem, there to wipe out his guilt
in the blood of Moslems.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this purpose of Louis <abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr> originated the second
crusade.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE SECOND CRUSADE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='chap24' class='c008'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-four'>XXIV.</abbr> <br> BERNARD—CONRAD <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr>—LOUIS <abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr>—SUGER—SIEGE OF DAMASCUS.</h3>
<p class='c006'>Pope Honorius delegated Bernard to preach
throughout France and Germany the renewal
of the holy war. Drawn as much
by the fame of the monk as by the mandates
of the king and the Pope, a vast assembly
of prelates and nobles gathered at Vezelay in
Burgundy. A large platform was erected on a hill
outside the city. King and monk stood together,
representing the combined will of earth and heaven.
The enthusiasm of the assembly of Clermont in 1095,
when Peter the Hermit and Urban <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> launched the
first crusade, was matched by the holy fervor inspired
by Bernard as he cried, “O ye who listen to me!
hasten to appease the anger of heaven, but no longer
implore its goodness by vain complaints. Clothe
yourselves in sackcloth, but also cover yourselves
with your impenetrable bucklers. The din of arms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the danger, the labors, the fatigues of war, are the
penances that God now imposes upon you. Hasten
then to expiate your sins by victories over the Infidels,
and let the deliverance of the holy places be
the reward of your repentance.” As in the olden
scene, the cry “Deus vult! Deus vult!” rolled over
the fields, and was echoed by the voice of the orator:
“Cursed be he who does not stain his sword with
blood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king set the example by prostrating himself
at the feet of the monk and receiving from his hands
the badge of the cross. “The cross! the cross!” was
the response of thousands who crowded about the
platform. Queen Eleanor imitated her husband, and
was followed by such a host of nobles, bishops, and
knights that Bernard tore his garments into strips to
supply the enthusiasts with the insignia of their new
devotion. Similar scenes were enacted throughout
France wherever the saint appeared. Eye-witnesses
do not hesitate to tell of miracles wrought by his
hands, emblazoning his mission with the seals of
heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enlistments were so many that Bernard wrote
to the Pope, “The villages and castles are deserted,
and there are none left but widows and orphans, whose
husbands and parents are still living.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The orator visited Germany. A diet of the empire
was at the time of his arrival convened at Spires.
The new emperor, Conrad <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr>, at first refused to
heed the more private counsel of Bernard to join the
crusade, urging in return the need of the imperial
hand upon the helm of state. One day Bernard was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>saying mass, when suddenly he stopped and pictured
Jesus Christ, armed with the cross and accompanied
by angels, reproaching the emperor for his indifference.
Conrad was as impotent to resist this eloquence
and assumption of divine authority as his predecessor
had been. He burst into tears and exclaimed, “I,
too, swear to go wherever Christ shall call me.” With
many of his lords and knights, he received the cross
from Bernard’s hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the Rhine to the Danube the enthusiasm
spread like an epidemic. No class had immunity
from it. Even thieves and cutthroats were so far
converted as to swear to rob and murder only Infidels.
Bernard’s gift of persuasion was unsurpassed since
the days of Pentecost, for men and races that could
not understand a word he said were as readily persuaded
as those who spoke the Frankish tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Roger of Sicily offered to convey the new armies
to Palestine in his fleets, urging the hereditary treachery
of the Greeks; for, though Alexius had “gone
to his own place” below, his grandson Manuel occupied
his place at Constantinople. The leaders,
however, preferred the perils of the land route to the
uncertainties of the deep.</p>

<p class='c007'>The government of France during the absence of
Louis <abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr> was committed to the hands of Suger,
Abbot of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Denis. A wiser choice could not have
been made. He had been the adviser of Louis the
Fat, and to his astuteness rather than to that of the
king were due the consolidation and development of
French autonomy, which made that reign notable.
An evidence of Suger’s foresight, as well as of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>independence and courage, is the fact that he, almost
alone of men, opposed the crusading scheme and
predicted its fatality. Only at the command of the
Pope did Suger assume the guardianship of the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not distrustful of the king, but credulous of the
heavenly mission of Bernard, the multitude, including
the most noted warriors, called for the monk to become
their military leader. Only the intervention of
the Holy Father, who declared that it was sufficient
for the saint to be the trumpet of Heaven without
wielding the sword, allayed the universal demand.
Thus at Whitsuntide, 1167, a hundred thousand
Frenchmen set out for their rendezvous at Metz.
Their monarch bore at their head the sacred banner
of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Denis, an oriflamme under which, at even that
early day, the kings of France believed themselves
invincible.</p>

<p class='c007'>But though royally commanded, the army was
somewhat a motley array. Troubadours joined the
host to relieve the tedium of the camp with their
songs of expected triumph. Ladies of the court and
soldiers’ wives graced and encumbered the enterprise.
One troop of female combatants was commanded by
an Amazon, whose gilded boots made her known as
“the lady with the legs of gold.” Old men and
children were carried along with the baggage. By the
side of the saint trudged the libertine and the criminal,
whose remorse had been kindled by the preaching
of Bernard, and whose search for the remission of sins
at Jerusalem was to poorly compensate the dissolute
outbursts of their unchanged natures along the way.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>The enthusiasm of the crusaders was not maintained
by those who remained at home, since upon
them fell the unromantic burden of providing money
for the army’s sustenance. The Jews were openly
robbed, the Abbot of Cluny declaring it a righteous
thing to despoil them of wealth acquired by usury
and sacrilege. Monasteries were bled of their long-accumulated
treasure. Churches sold their ornaments
and mortgaged their lands to supply the enormous
demand. Thus the huzzas of the departing were
echoed by the suppressed groans of those who were
left behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Germans under Conrad <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> had preceded the
French. Before they reached Constantinople they
had more than once to punish with violence the
chronic perfidy of the Greeks. The Germans burned
the monastery at Adrianople to avenge the assassination
of one of their comrades. Beyond the Bosporus
Conrad’s soldiers were incessantly picked off
and slain by skulking Greeks. The flour they purchased
from the merchants of Constantinople they
found mixed with lime. The Greek guides were in
alliance with the Turks, and led the Christians into
ambuscades among the defiles of the Taurus. Conrad
himself was twice wounded by treacherous arrows,
and his host, reduced to one tenth of its original
numbers, was forced to painfully retrace the way to
Nicæa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French were at first more cordially received
by the Greeks than had been their German allies;
but they soon learned that the Emperor Manuel was
in collusion with the Sultan of Iconium. Louis hardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>restrained his people from taking vengeance by assaulting
the Greek capital, and forced them onward
to the relief of the Germans. Conrad did not await
their coming, but returned to Constantinople and
made temporary fellowship with his betrayer. The
French, thus deserted, continued their route alone.
The Moslems massed against them on the bank of
the Meander, only to be scattered by the fury of the
French onset, or, if we may believe some of the
spectators, by the appearance of the familiar celestial
knight clad in white armor, who headed the Christian
army.</p>

<p class='c007'>Flushed with victory, Louis hastened onward two
days’ march beyond Laodicea. Here he divided his
force into two bands for the safer passage of a mountain
ridge. The vanguard was ordered to encamp
upon the heights until joined by their comrades, that
they might make descent in full force upon the farther
plains. But the impatience of the soldiers in the
advance, encouraged by Queen Eleanor, could not
brook the cautionary command; they descended the
other side of the ridge. The wary Turks quietly took
the ground thus unwisely abandoned. The second
division of the French, mistaking them for friends,
climbed the ascent without regard to orderly array,
and were welcomed by a murderous assault. The
king barely escaped after witnessing the slaughter of
thirty of his chief nobles at his side. Alone upon a
rock which he had climbed, he kept his assailants at
bay until they, mistaking him for a common soldier,
withdrew for some worthier prize. The heavy arms
of the Franks were worse than useless against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>storm of rocks and arrows which the Turks rained
upon them, and the morning that dawned after a
night of unparalleled terror revealed a miserable
remnant of the French force fighting or stealing its
way to the vanguard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Placing the command in the hands of the veteran
Gilbert, and Evrard des Barras, Grand Master of the
Templars, who had marched from the East to assist
the new crusaders, Louis pressed on. Winter fell
with unwonted severity upon his ragged and starving
retainers. The Greeks held Attalia and refused to
allow the Franks to enter that city. At length Louis
accepted their offer to transport a portion of his army
by sea to Syria. Leaving a large proportion of his
camp, the king set sail, and arrived at Antioch in
March, 1148. Less than one quarter of his followers
met him on the Syrian soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Franks, thus abandoned by their king, had
incessantly to fight with the swarming Turks, until
human nature succumbed. Their leaders, Archambaud
and Thierri, deserted them and followed the
king over the sea. Seven thousand essayed to pursue
their journey overland, and were massacred, or perished
amid the dangers of the way. The old chronicle
says, “God alone knows the number of the
martyrs whose blood flowed beneath the blade of the
Turks and even under the sword of the Greeks.”
Three thousand are said to have lost their faith in
the protection of Christ and sought the pity of the
Moslems by confessing the Prophet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Raymond of Poitiers was at this time lord and
commandant at Antioch, and welcomed the King of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>France with the expectation of receiving his help in
the conquest of Aleppo and Cæsarea, but as much,
say the chronicles, for the sake of the ladies who
accompanied him as for his military aid. Queen
Eleanor was Raymond’s niece, and with her suite
were several of the most celebrated beauties from the
courts of Europe. Their presence promised to make
Antioch again the brilliant and voluptuous city it had
been of old. When the king proposed to move southward
to Jerusalem his queen refused to accompany
him. Some secret ambition, or a motive less creditable
to her virtue, led her to such disregard for the
king that she announced her rejection of her marriage
vows, alleging as her reason some newly awakened
scruples of conscience on the ground of premarital
kinship with Louis. Her husband was compelled to
kidnap his wife and carry her by force from the
palace to the camp. This estrangement was the beginning
of the rupture of relations between the King
and Queen of France, that led to his ultimate repudiation
of her and to her subsequent marriage with
Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> of England, by whom she became the
mother of Richard Cœur de Lion.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Jerusalem Louis and Conrad finally met, the
latter without soldiers, having reached the city in the
disguise of a pilgrim. After paying the proper tribute
of devotion at the sacred shrines, the two Western
sovereigns, with Baldwin <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr>, King of Jerusalem,
and their chief barons, gathered at <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Jean d’Acre
to determine upon the coming campaign. The assembly
was graced by the presence of Queen Melisende
of Jerusalem and many ladies from the courts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>of Europe; but there came neither the Queen of
France nor her advisers, Raymond of Antioch and
the counts of Edessa and Tripoli.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conference determined to attempt the capture
of Damascus. The Christians quickly invested that
place. It was defended on the east and south by
high walls, but was more exposed on the north and
west. Here the richness of the Syrian oasis burst
into a vast garden, watered by crystal streams from
the Antilibanus. The extended plain was divided
into numerous private possessions by walls of baked
earth, between which a dense growth of trees left
scarcely more than foot-paths. In spite of the showers
of arrows that greeted them at every dividing wall,
the Christians steadily made their way. In the front
ranks was the young King of Jerusalem, with his
redoubtable Knights of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John and Knights Templars.
The King of France pressed next with his
braves, eager to redeem by splendid victory the disaster
of their coming. The German emperor, with
such meagre remnant of his army as he could muster,
protected the rear. At the little river which flows
beneath the western wall of the city the invaders met
their first check. Here Conrad performed the one
deed creditable to his career since leaving Germany.
With his little band he passed through the forward
ranks and fell upon the enemy. The Saracens, seeing
that the day was lost if the fight continued general,
sent a gigantic warrior to challenge the German hero
to single combat. The two armies watched the fight.
Conrad unhorsed and slew his antagonist. The
Saracens then prepared to abandon their city. Arabic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>chroniclers describe the humiliation of their brethren
as they prostrated themselves upon heaps of ashes,
and in the great mosque of Damascus sat round
Omar’s copy of the Koran, invoking the help of their
Prophet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Christians, confident of the issue, fell to disputing
the sovereignty of the as yet unconquered
city. It was awarded to Thierri of Alsace, Count of
Flanders. This decision instantly produced jealousy,
and all concert of action was at an end. The warriors
of Syria hated the Germans and Franks, who had
come to eat the fruit of victory as well as to help
gather it. At once the assault ceased. The wily
Saracen commander, familiar with the divisions in the
Christian camp, took advantage of them. He declared
that in the event of the siege being pressed he
would turn over the city to Nourredin of Mosul,
an enemy whose power and daring would make the
occupancy of Damascus fatal to the existence of the
Christian kingdom of Jerusalem. Mussulman writers
aver that King Baldwin was also directly bribed by
the people of Damascus; Latin writers accuse the
Templars of perfidy. It is evident that none of the
leaders cared to conquer Damascus if its possession
was not to be his portion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the dilemma the Syrians advised a change of
base. The rage and cupidity of the various parties
blinded all to the stupidity of this plan. The army
swung round from the gardens they had conquered,
and faced the impregnable walls that rose from the
desert side. With neither water nor natural protection,
they camped in the open, arid plain. At this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>juncture twenty thousand Turkomans and Kurds
arrived and joined the defenders. Among the Saracens
was Ayoub, the founder of the dynasty of
Ayoubites, and with him his son Saladin, afterwards
to become the most famous of Moslem leaders, then
a lad of thirteen years, who was here to receive his
first baptism of blood as he saw his eldest brother
slain in a sortie.</p>

<p class='c007'>The succor received by the enemy led the Christians
to raise the siege as ignominiously as they had
bravely begun it. Conrad in disgust returned to
Germany. Louis remained a year longer, vainly
seeking some enterprise in which to brighten his
sword. It was not until his barons and knights had
deserted him, and his minister, Suger, in the name of
the French nation, had urged his return, that in July,
1149, he sailed from <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Jean d’Acre.</p>

<p class='c007'>Europe felt the shame of the ill-advised second
crusade. The discredit fell sorely upon its chief
advocate. Bernard was compelled to lead Christendom
in the Miserere rather than the Te Deum. “We
have fallen on evil days,” he exclaimed, “in which
the Lord, provoked by our sins, has judged the world
with justice, indeed, but not with His wonted mercy.”
The saint seems almost to have lost his faith. “Why,”
he cried, “has not God regarded our fasts, and appeared
to know nothing of our humiliations? With
what patience is He now listening to the sacrilegious
and blasphemous voices of the nations of Arabia, who
accuse Him of having led His people into the desert
that they might perish! All the world knows that
the judgments of the Lord are just, but this is so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>profound an abyss that he is happy who has not been
disgraced by it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The only one who benefited by the movement
was Suger, whose repute for wisdom was exalted not
only by the fact that he had uttered his warning
against the undertaking, but more by the skill with
which he had conducted the affairs of the kingdom
during the absence of its nominal head. He died not
long after the disasters he predicted, leaving France
more prosperous than before. Of him it is significantly
said that “he served faithfully a young king
without losing his friendship.” Foreign visitors to
Paris called him the “Solomon of his age.” Louis
<abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr> paid him a filial compliment by naming him the
“father of his country.” His friend Bernard soon
followed him to the grave, having won the honorable
distinction of the “last father of the church.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>
  <h3 id='chap25' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-five'>XXV.</abbr> <br> NOURREDIN—RISE OF SALADIN—KING GUY—QUEEN SIBYLLA.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The return of the two royal crusaders was
not so much of an affliction to the kingdom
of Jerusalem as it was felt to be a
disgrace to their own nations. Relieved
of their rivalry, King Baldwin <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> took
counsel of his own ambition to avenge the recent
disasters. He found himself pitted against the most
astute leader the Moslem cause had yet produced.
Nourredin had swept like a cyclone over Mesopotamia
and northern Syria, had conquered all his competitors,
and established his throne at Damascus. Leaving
Ayoub, the father of Saladin, as governor, he was
pouring his invincible warriors southward.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nourredin was more than a soldier; he had mastered
much of the science of the age, and displayed
a statesman’s clemency and justice in administration.
As a thorough religionist he held his power in stewardship
of his cause and refused all personal emolument
from his position. His wife once complained
of the trivial value of his gifts to her; he replied, “I
have naught else, for all I have I hold only as treasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>for the faithful.” He treated his soldiers as his children;
if any of them fell in battle he made their
families his care, anticipating thus the modern system
of army pensions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baldwin <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr>, undeterred by the greatness of his
rival, besieged and captured Ascalon, whose wealth
suggested the Arabic title of the “Spouse of Syria”
(August 12, 1153). Four years later he assaulted
Cæsarea on the Orontes, and would have gained the
place but for the outburst of the chronic jealousy
among the Christians. In 1159 he obtained for wife
Theodora, niece of the Emperor Manuel of Constantinople,
and with her munificent dowry the alliance
of the Greeks. Manuel appeared in Syria with an
enormous army, which, however, accomplished little
and withdrew, having been quickly appeased by the
shrewdness of Nourredin, or, as some say, having
been frightened by news of insurrection in Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nourredin then extended his ravages, avoiding
direct encounter with Baldwin, who died February
10, 1163, and is said to have been poisoned by the
court physician at Antioch. The magnanimity of
Nourredin and his appreciation of the character of
young Baldwin were illustrated by his reply to those
who urged this as an opportune time for assault upon
Jerusalem: “No; we should pity this people’s sorrow,
for they have lost a prince whose like is not now left
in the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Amaury (Amalric) succeeded his brother, Baldwin
<abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr>, on the throne. Had his gains equalled his ambition,
his power would have dominated far beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>any boundaries the Christian sword had as yet set to
the kingdom of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moslem world was nominally divided between
the Syrian caliph of Bagdad and the Egyptian caliph
of Cairo. Egypt was wretchedly governed. The
caliph of Cairo was but a creature of his viziers.
Amaury, seeing the possibility of extending his domains
to the Nile, took arms against him. In 1163
he sent an army which might have held the country,
had it not been driven out by the enemy’s flooding
the valley of the Nile. One party in Egypt invoked
the assistance of Nourredin, who sent as his general
Shirkuh the Kurd, uncle of Saladin. Amaury accomplished
against him the capture of Pelusium in
1164. In 1167 he took Alexandria, commanded at
the time by young Saladin. He later penetrated to
Cairo and laid El Fostat in ashes. In 1168 Shirkuh
renewed the war. Amaury, marching from Egypt
to meet his antagonist in the desert, was flanked by
that general, who suddenly occupied the land left
undefended. Amaury, who had married a niece of
the Emperor Manuel, made with the Greeks an unsuccessful
attack upon Damietta. Here the Christians
felt the hand of one who was destined ultimately to
overthrow all their power in the East. Saladin was
in command. On the death of Shirkuh he had been
appointed vizier by the caliph of Cairo. The caliph,
wearied of being controlled by designing and capable
men who absorbed in their own interests the power
they defended, selected Saladin, thinking that the
young man’s inexperience would be less of a menace
to the caliphate.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Nourredin, however, divined the genius of the
young vizier and assigned to him the supreme command
in Egypt. He then deposed the caliph, and
with his reign brought to an end the dynasty of the
Fatimites, which for two hundred years had held the
land of the Nile. Thus Nourredin ruled supreme
from Babylonia to the desert of Libya. Only the
kingdom of Jerusalem marred the map of his dominion.
To reconquer this for Islam was his incessant
purpose. With his own hands he made a pulpit, from
which he promised the faithful one day to preach in
the mosque of Omar on the temple site.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Moslem world was already attached to one
destined to be greater than Nourredin. The youth
of Saladin had been one of apparent indolence and
dissipation, but he veiled beneath his indifference the
finest genius and most unbounded ambition. As
soon as he felt the possession of power he assumed a
corresponding dignity, and men recognized him as
one appointed of Heaven. Turbulent emirs, who had
ignored him as a chance holder of position, now sat
reverently before him. Even the priests were struck
with the sincere austerity of his devotion. The caliph
of Bagdad bestowed upon him the distinguished dignity
of the vest of honor. Poets began to mingle his
name with those of heroes as the rising star. The
pious included it in their prayers as the hope of Islam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Knowing that experience is often wiser than genius,
Saladin judiciously guarded himself from the errors
of youth by associating his father, Ayoub, with him
in the government of Egypt. Nourredin, whose successful
career had allowed him no jealousy of ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>men, showed that he was restless at the popularity
and ability displayed by his young subaltern, and
was preparing to take Egypt under his own immediate
government when death, his first vanquisher, came
upon the veteran (May, 1174). Saladin immediately
proclaimed himself Sultan of Egypt, and hastened to
secure the succession of Nourredin’s power as Sultan
of Damascus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two months later (July, 1174) Amaury followed
his great competitor to the grave, and the kingdom
of Jerusalem fell to his son, Baldwin <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr>, a leprous
lad of thirteen years. The personal contrast of this
sovereign with Saladin was ominous of the contrast
between the coming history of the two powers they
respectively led. The education of Baldwin was conducted
by William of Tyre, the chief historian of this
period. The regency of the kingdom was disputed
by Milo de Plausy and Raymond, Count of Tripoli.
Raymond was great-grandson of Raymond of Toulouse,
the renowned leader of the first crusade, and
inherited, together with his ancestor’s bravery, his
impatience and passion for personal precedence. He
deemed that he had a right to the highest emoluments
of the kingdom as compensation for having suffered
eight years’ imprisonment among the Infidels. Milo
was elected regent by the barons, but was shortly
afterwards assassinated by unknown hands on the
street. Raymond succeeded to the regency. The
suspicion of having instigated the murder of his rival
was supplemented by a later suspicion that he secretly
betrayed the Christian cause in the interest of Saladin.
It is not necessary to believe this, as the prowess of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the new ruler of Egypt is sufficient to account for his
successes. Raymond was unwise in his movements;
he busied himself with a wretched attempt upon
Alexandria, and then made truce with Saladin in the
north just at a moment when peace enabled the
young Saracen to strengthen his power over his
Mohammedan neighbors.</p>

<p class='c007'>In time Baldwin <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr> took the reins into his own
hands. Saladin was pouring his forces over the Holy
Land. His newly organized troop of Mamelukes
formed his body-guard. Baldwin shut himself up in
Ascalon, but soon the general devastation of his kingdom
maddened the Christians to desperation. They
issued from Ascalon with such fury that the Egyptian
army was swept from the field and but few of
Saladin’s soldiers lived to accompany their young
leader back to Cairo.</p>

<p class='c007'>This defeat, far from depressing the courage of
Saladin, only taught him new lessons of caution.
Little by little his sword carved away the Christian
kingdom, until Baldwin was forced to sign a truce.
Renaud, Lord of Carac, broke this compact, and with
the aid of an army of Templars plundered the Moslem
caravans, massacring defenceless men and capturing
the women. He made an incursion as far as Arabia,
and announced his purpose of going to Mecca to
plunder the tomb of the Prophet. But the swift
riders of Saladin were upon his track. Renaud
barely escaped, many of his troops being captured.
Most of these were put to death in Egypt, a few
being reserved as victims in the annual sacrifice at
Mecca. Saladin was infuriated by Renaud’s breach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>of faith, and won the title of “Scourge of God,” even
among the Christians, by the swift and fearful retaliation
which he took upon the cities of northern
Palestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The increasing leprosy of Baldwin rendered him
incapable of discharging his royal duties. A sort of
political leprosy or dry-rot seemed to infect the state.
The crown retained its shape, but not its lustre, for
it could not control the internecine strife of the Christian
barons, who waged war upon one another from
their mountain fastnesses. The Hospitallers and
Templars, too, combined against the priesthood, and
hooted and shot at them as they went to the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre. The priests retaliated by
gathering the arrows and placing them on the Mount
of Olives, calling heaven to avenge the insult offered
to its ministers. The various nations represented by
the influx of pilgrims added to the confusion by reviving
in Palestine the prejudices of sections of Europe.
Vice everywhere had open license. William of Tyre,
in describing the condition of affairs, drops his pen,
lest his readers should accuse him of defaming human
nature by his recital. Agents were sent to the courts
of Europe, appealing for succor to the kingdom, which
was falling to pieces in punishment of its own demerits.
The piety of Christendom made no response
except in pity for a government which they called
“Christ’s Second Crown of Thorns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Baldwin <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr> died in 1185. Baldwin <abbr title='the fifth'>V.</abbr>, a child,
had been crowned as his successor two years before.
This prince was the child of Sibylla by her first husband,
the Marquis of Montferrat. Since the death of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the marquis she had married Guy of Lusignan. Little
King Baldwin died a year later (1186). Sibylla was
accused of having poisoned her own child to advance
her new husband’s interest. The suspicion
was not lessened by her adoption of a disgraceful ruse
to gain for Guy the vacant throne. As the daughter
of one king of Jerusalem and sister of another, she
might have held the sovereignty but for the opposition
to Guy, whom she associated with herself in the
government. She proposed to the chiefs that she
should divorce Guy, saying, “If a divorce takes place
between me and my husband, I wish you to make me
sure by your oaths that whomsoever I shall make
choice of for my husband you will choose for your
head and lord.” She then swore that she would
award him whom she regarded as the ablest defender
of Jerusalem with her hand and crown. This was
agreed to. The patriarch solemnly announced her
divorce and placed the crown in her hands. Sibylla,
to the surprise of all, turned to Guy and, placing the
crown upon his head, boldly declared, “I make choice
of thee as king and as my lord; for whom God hath
joined together let not man put asunder.” The audacity
of Sibylla apparently cowed the warriors about
her; they acquiesced, and some even applauded the
cleverness of her deceit.</p>

  <h3 id='chap26' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-six'>XXVI.</abbr> <br> BATTLE OF TIBERIAS—FALL OF JERUSALEM.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In the meantime Saladin had gathered into
his hand the reins of Egypt and western
Asia. In 1185 the Christians of Palestine
sent an appeal for aid to all the courts of
Europe. The imminence and magnitude
of the danger led them to select the most important
dignitaries as their messengers: Heraclius, the Patriarch
of Jerusalem, together with the Grand Masters
of the Hospitallers and Templars. The ambassadors
offered the crown of Jerusalem to King Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> of
England, presenting him with the keys of the Holy
Sepulchre and of the tower of David. The appeal of
the East was seconded by Pope Lucius, whose letter
to Henry shows that Europe dreaded as much as it
pretended to despise the new Moslem leader. The
letter read: “For Saladin, the most inhuman persecutor,
has arisen to such a pitch in his fury that, unless
the vehement onset of his wickedness is checked,
he may entertain an assured hope that all the Jordan
will flow into his mouth, and the land be polluted by
his most abominable superstitions, and the country
once more be subjected to the accursed dominion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the most nefarious tyrant. By the sorrows thus imminent,
we entreat your Mightiness with a palpitating
heart,” etc. But neither King Henry’s conscience
nor his hope of gaining a brighter crown in heaven
was sufficient to lure him from projects nearer home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Saladin quickly verified the Pope’s estimate of his
ability. In May, 1187, he overthrew the Templars
in a battle at Nazareth. With eighty thousand horse
he then invested and crushed Tiberias on Galilee.
The citadel of this place alone remained untaken.
The Christians massed fifty thousand men on the
plain of Hattîn, above the city, for one supreme endeavor.
The boldest feared the result. The sight
of the wood of the True Cross gave a martyr courage
rather than hope of success. Raymond, whose bravery
no man questioned, made an address to the assembled
barons, counselling retreat. He said: “In
this army is the only hope left to the Christians of
the East. Here are gathered all the soldiers of Christ,
all the defenders of Jerusalem. The archers of Saladin
are more skilful than ours, his cavalry more
numerous and better trained. Let us abandon Tiberias
and save the army.” To lose that battle in the
open plain would be, as Raymond foresaw, to lose
everything. To retreat might force the enemy to
fight against strongholds, when the advantage would
be on the Christians’ side.</p>

<p class='c007'>This discreet counsel of the veteran was derided
by the Master of the Templars, who openly taunted
Raymond with some secret alliance with Saladin.
Raymond rejoined, “I will submit to the punishment
of death if these things do not fall out as I have said.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>The barons were for following the advice of the veteran,
but King Guy, after various changes of mind,
gave the fatal order for battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day (July 4, 1187) was excessively hot. The
Christians, worn out with the march, advanced to the
fight, sustained chiefly by the desperation of their
resolve. The Mussulmans occupied the vantage-ground
on the hills which make the western shore of
the Lake of Tiberias, and welcomed their adversaries’
approach with a furious discharge of arrows. Then
suddenly, as lightning through a pelting storm, the
white turbans and cimeters of the Saracen cavalry,
led by Saladin in person, flashed across the field. In
the language of the Arabic chronicler: “Then the
sons of paradise and the children of fire settled their
terrible quarrel. Arrows hurtled in the air like a noisy
flight of sparrows, and the blood of warriors dripped
upon the ground like rain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The True Cross, which had animated the Christians’
courage, was an occasion of their weakness; for, despairing
of victory through their own valor, they
sought the protection of the emblem of their religion.
Saladin said afterwards that the Franks flew round the
cross like moths round a light. Again and again the
sultan drove his squadrons through the thickest ranks
of his opponents, and would that day have sealed
the Christians’ fate had not night given recess to the
battle. During the darkness the Christians closed
their ranks in dense array. The Saracens, having
superior numbers, adopted the opposite plan and extended
their lines, so that when morning broke they
surrounded their antagonists on every side. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Christians in vain tried to break the cordon, which
was steadily drawing closer and closer, limiting the
space within it as one by one the doomed knights
fell. The Saracens fired the grass of the plain.
Swords flashed through the lurid smoke, and the
bravest, whom arms could not daunt, dropped from
suffocation. The Templars and Hospitallers maintained
the battle all day long, rallying about the
cross; but that symbol was ultimately taken. It
was being borne by Rufinus, Bishop of Acre, when
he fell, pierced with an arrow. Says a contemporary
writer: “This was done through the righteous judgment
of God; for, contrary to the usage of his predecessors,
having greater faith in worldly arms than
in heavenly ones, he went forth to battle equipped in
a coat of mail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Guy was a captive, together with the Master of the
Templars and many of the most celebrated knights,
who had failed to find death, though they sought it.
Raymond cut his way through the line of Saracens,
who praised his amazing valor as they witnessed his
exploit, while the Christians denounced him for connivance
with the foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>A scene followed which showed the temper of
Saladin. The conqueror received King Guy and his
surviving nobles in a manner to lessen, if possible,
their chagrin for the disaster. He presented to the
king a great goblet filled with drink, which had been
cooled in the snows from the Lebanons. Having
drunk from it, Guy passed the cup to Renaud, the
man who had violated the truce in former years.
Saladin could be magnanimous to a worthy antagonist.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>So great was his self-command that he observed
the most punctilious etiquette even in the rage of a
hand-to-hand fight. But to the false and treacherous
he could show no mercy. The sight of the truce-breaker
fired him with uncontrollable frenzy; he exclaimed,
“That traitor shall not drink in my presence.”
He gave Renaud the instant choice of death or acceptance
of the religion of Mohammed. Renaud refused
to subscribe the Koran. Saladin smote him
with the side of his sabre, a mark of his contempt.
At a signal a common soldier swirled his cimeter, and
the head of Renaud fell at King Guy’s feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards the Templars and Hospitallers the sultan
had conceived similar hatred from the conviction that
they regarded their covenants with their enemies too
lightly. As these knights of the white and the red
cross were led past him Saladin remarked, “I will
deliver the earth of these two unclean races.” He
bade his emirs each slay a knight with his own hand.
Neither the defenceless condition of the captives nor
the protestation of his warriors against this cruelty
produced any compunction in the breast of the resolute
conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four days later <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Jean d’ Acre fell under Saladin’s
assault; but the people were spared and allowed to
depart with all their movable property. The churches
were converted into mosques, and resounded with
prayers and thanksgiving to the Prophet. The yellow
flag of Saladin soon floated from the walls of Jericho,
Ramleh, Arsuf, Jaffa, and Beirut. Ascalon resisted
for a while, in spite of the threats of the conqueror
and the entreaty of his prisoner, King Guy, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>garrison should not prolong the useless conflict. The
defenders of the city refused submission unless the
victor should pledge the safety of the women and
children and the liberty of the king. Saladin honored
their bravery by acceding to these conditions, and
Ascalon became his possession (September 4th).</p>

<p class='c007'>Two weeks later (September 18th) his troops invested
Jerusalem. Sending for the principal inhabitants,
he said to them: “I, as well as you, acknowledge
Jerusalem to be the house of God; I will not defile
its sanctity with blood if I can gain it by peace and
love. Surrender it by your Whitsuntide, and I will
bestow upon you liberty to go where you will, with
provisions in plenty and as much land as you can
cultivate.” The reply of the Christians was valiant:
“We cannot yield the city in which died our God;
still less can we sell it to you.” Saladin then swore
to avenge the slaughter perpetrated by the Christians
upon the Moslems when, under Godfrey, the first
crusaders had captured Jerusalem and massacred its
inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The assault was furious and met with equal valor.
Within and without, the walls were fairly buttressed
with the bodies of the fallen. It was not until the
principal gate was undermined, the ramparts tottering,
and the soldiers of Saladin occupying some of the
towers, that Balian d’Iselin, the commandant, proposed
to accept the conditions the Christians had
rejected before the fight. “It is too late,” replied
Saladin, pointing to his yellow banners, which proclaimed
his occupancy of many places along the walls.
“Very well,” replied Balian; “we will destroy the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>city. The mosque of Omar, and the mysterious
Stone of Jacob which you worship, shall be pounded
into dust. Five thousand Moslems whom we retain
shall be killed. We will then slay with our own hands
our wives and children, and march out to you with
fire and sword. Not one of us will go to paradise
until he has sent ten Mussulmans to hell.” Saladin
again bowed to the bravery which he might have
punished, and accepted the capitulation (October 2,
1187).</p>

<p class='c007'>The Christian warriors were permitted to retire to
Tripoli or Tyre, cities as yet unconquered by Saladin.
The inhabitants were to be ransomed at a nominal
sum of money for each. Many, however, in their
poverty could not produce the required amount. The
fact, reported to the victor, led to a deed on his part
which showed his natural kindliness, together with the
exactness of his rule. The ransom money could not
be remitted; it belonged of right to the men whose
heroism had been blessed of Allah in taking the city.
Saladin and his brother, Malek-Ahdel, paid from
their own purses the redemption money for several
thousand Christians, who otherwise, according to the
usages of war, would have become the slaves of their
conquerors.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the day for the evacuation of the city Saladin
erected his throne at the Gate of David to review the
wretched army of the vanquished as it passed out.
First came the patriarch and priests, carrying the
sacred vessels and treasures of the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre. Next followed Queen Sibylla with
the remnant of her court. Saladin saluted her with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>great courtesy, and added words of seemingly genuine
consolation as he noted her grief. Mothers carried
their children, and strong men bore the aged and sick
in their arms. Some paused to address the sultan,
asking that members of their families from whom they
were separated might be restored to them. Saladin
instantly ordered that in no case should children be
separated from their mothers, nor husbands from their
wives. He permitted the Hospitallers to remain in
the city on condition of their resuming those duties
which their order was originally instituted to perform,
and committed to them the care of the sick who could
not endure being removed. Many writers are disposed
to analyze the motives of Saladin and to attribute
his clemency to politic foresight in subduing the
hatred as well as the arms of his enemies. But surely
the annals of war are too barren of such acts of humanity
to allow us to mar the beauty of the simple
narration; and the virtues of Christians in such circumstances
have not been so resplendent that they
may not emulate the spirit of one who was their
noblest foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new lord of Jerusalem purged the sacred city
of what to him was the taint of idolatry, the worship
of Jesus. The mosque of Omar on the temple site
was washed within and without with rose-water. The
pulpit which Nourredin had made with his own hands
was erected by the side of the mihrab, towards which
the people prayed as indicating the direction of Mecca.
The chief imam preached from it on the glories of
Saladin, “the resplendent star of Allah,” on the redemption
of Jerusalem, from which Mohammed had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>made his miraculous night journey to Mecca, and on
the holy war, which must be continued until “all
the branches of impiety should be cut” from the tree
of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The joy of the Moslem world had its refrain in the
wails of Europe. It is said that Pope Urban <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr>, on
hearing the news, died of a broken heart. The minstrels
composed lamentations as the captives did by
the rivers of Babylon. Courts and churches were
draped in mourning. The superstitious saw tears fall
from the eyes of the wooden and stone saints that
ornamented the churches. The general gloom was
described by one who felt it as “like the darkness
over the earth from the sixth to the ninth hour, when
Christ was crucified.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>Forty years had elapsed since the ill-fated
crusade of Louis <abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr> and Conrad (1147)
to avenge the capture of Edessa by
Zenghi, and the crowning calamity, the
fall of Jerusalem into the hands of Saladin
(1187). We may briefly note some of the conditions
and changes in Europe during this period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Men were thinking, though the dense darkness of
mediæval night yet remained, and the spectres of
superstition which inhabited the human mind were
as many and as strange as ever. For example, the
year 1186 was looked for with alarm by the people
of northern Europe, because of the predictions of astrologers
that certain conjunctions of the stars then
betokened dire evils to mankind. In the language of
a contemporary: “The planets being in an aërial and
windy sign, ... there shall arise in the East a mighty
wind, and with its stormy blasts it shall blacken the air
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>and corrupt it with poisonous stench.... The wind
shall raise aloft the sands and dust from the face of
the earth, and utterly overwhelm such cities as Mecca,
Baldac [Bagdad], and Babylon. The regions of
Egypt and Ethiopia shall become almost uninhabitable.
In the West shall arise dissensions, raised by
the wind, and seditions of the people shall take place;
and there shall be one of them who shall levy armies
innumerable, and shall wage war on the shores of the
waters, on which a slaughter so vast will take place
that the flow of blood will equal the surging waves.
This conjunction signifies the mutation of kingdoms,
the superiority of the Franks, the destruction of the
Saracenic race, together with longer life to those who
shall be born hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Other astrologers blew their star-blasts of similar
warning. More startling still were the reported words
of a pious monk, which he chanted while in a trance,
confirming the astrologers with rhapsodic quotations
from Scripture and the Greek mythologists. The
popular consternation was somewhat allayed by
Pharamella the Moor, whose humanity was stronger
than his religious bigotry, and led him to write to the
Christian Bishop of Toledo, from the tower on which
he was watching the stars, that their prognostications
of the “aërial or windy signs” were wrong; but that
there would be sufficient force of evil abroad in the
atmosphere to produce “scanty vintage, crops of only
moderate average, much slaughter by the sword, and
many shipwrecks.” The most serious chroniclers of
the time still associated as effect and cause the rise
and fall of kings and the issue of battles with natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>phenomena of comets, eclipses, and storms. Epidemic
madness continued to see celestial warriors
through the dust of earthly combat, and the ubiquitous
presence of the mother of God in churches and
cells, in the silence of the roadway, and, in company
with Mary Magdalene, trudging along amid bands of
pilgrims. Men visited purgatory and returned to describe
its burning floor and the writhing shapes of its
inhabitants. Indeed, the human mind was not yet
sufficiently awake to know that it had been dreaming.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet here and there were those who threw off the
age delusion. The logic of Abélard and the love of
liberty voiced by Arnold of Brescia roused more than
one of the sleepers, who kept awake and jostled their
fellows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the sect of the Waldenses foretokened the
rise of modern Protestantism. Peter Waldo, a wealthy
merchant of Lyons, was afflicted with the rigors of
ecclesiastical rule, which robbed more than it protected
the people, and with the dogmatic traditions
of the church, which were being manipulated as
strangling strings about the mind. He threw off
these restraints; he devoted his large fortune to the
relief of the poor and organized a brotherhood of
kindred spirits, who took the name of the Poor Men
of Lyons. There had as yet been no attempt to teach
the masses the simple religion of Jesus as contained
in the Scriptures, Jerome’s Latin Bible of the fourth
century being the only translation in use. Waldo
secured a rendering of the four Gospels into French.
The reading of this by the people led them to dissent
from the assumptions of the Roman Church, to question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>its sacraments, and to deny to the priesthood the
sole prerogative of preaching and administering religion.
Waldo and his followers claimed liberty to expound
the Word of God according to its own rules,
and to interpret its precepts in the light of reason and
prayer-illuminated conscience.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Waldenses were at once proceeded against by
the Bishop of Lyons as heretics and rebels. His
judgment was confirmed by the anathemas of the
papal see. Waldo and his friends fled to the mountains
of Piedmont and Dauphine. In 1179 the new
doctrines were denounced by the Third Lateran
Council. Waldo died the same year, having lived
long enough to anticipate in his own person the
persecutions which were to make his sect forever
famous among martyrs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of the Papacy during this period was
humiliating. Popes and antipopes strove for the seat
of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter. The hierarchy invoked the aid of the
Emperor of Germany, Frederick Barbarossa, to overturn
the republic of Rome, which Arnold of Brescia
had inspired. That leader atoned for his audacity by
being hanged and burned. Barbarossa was, however,
equally determined that the secular power of the
popes should not be rebuilt upon the ruins of Roman
independence. Italy was laid waste by the armies
of the empire, until the centre of Christendom was
disgraced by scenes as cruel as those which marked
the contention of Christian and Turk in the East.</p>

<p class='c007'>France was scarcely less unfortunate. Louis <abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr>,
shortly after his return from Palestine, divorced his
queen, Eleanor, who became the wife of Henry of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Anjou, afterwards Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> of England, and added
to the possession of England the territories of Aquitaine
and Poitou, leaving to the French monarchy
less than half of what had been, and was again to be,
the land of France. Guizot remarks: “This was the
only event under Louis’s reign of any real importance,
in view of its long and bloody consequences to his
country. A petty war or a sullen strife between the
kings of France and England, petty quarrels of Louis
with some of the great lords of his kingdom, some
vigorous measures against certain districts, the first
bubblings of that religious fermentation which resulted
before long, in the south of France, in the crusade
against the Albigensians—such were the facts
which went to make up with somewhat of insipidity
the annals of this reign.” Kingship, on the death of
the Abbé Suger, Louis’s prime minister, steadily declined,
until Philip Augustus opened for it a new era
of strength and progress. Philip had been seven
years on the throne (from 1080) at the time of the
capture of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c007'>England at the beginning of this period was distressed
with the war between King Stephen and
Matilda. Churches were converted into fortifications,
and castles into prisons. For nineteen years the
country was so ravaged by the contending parties
that, in the language of the contemporary chronicler,
“to till the ground was to plough the sea,” and brave
men, “sickened with the unnatural war, put on the
white cross and sailed for a nobler battle-field in the
East.” With the son of Matilda, Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, the
dynasty of the Angevins, or Plantagenets, was established.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Inheriting Normandy from his mother, and
acquiring by his marriage with Eleanor her estates, at
the age of twenty-one Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> ruled from the Arctic
Ocean to the Pyrenees. “Though a foreigner, never
speaking the English tongue, he seems to have possessed
something of the spirit which produced the subsequent
Anglican civilization. He abolished feudalism
as a system of government, and left it little more than
a system of land tenure. It was he who defined the
relations established between church and state, and
declared that in England churchman as well as baron
was to be held under the common law” (Norgate).
Though his quarrel with and murder of Thomas à
Becket left in suspension the Constitutions of Clarendon,
which gave the kingship preëminence over the
hierarchy, the principles of that document were soon
revived. Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> admitted no papal legate into
England without an oath not to interfere with any
royal prerogative. Though he repented the death of
Becket, he forced the monks of Canterbury to elect
a successor of his own nomination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the most important progress of Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>’s
reign was marked by the Assizes of Clarendon (1166),
which gave to England the beginning of trial by jury.
A grand jury of twelve men was to hear all accusations,
and only on sufficient evidence allow further
procedure, although the final trial of a case was, until
1216, allowed to proceed according to the laws of
Ordeal and Combat. Circuit judges were also appointed,
subject only to the king and his council as a
court of appeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1155 Ireland was given over to the conquest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Henry by Pope Hadrian for one penny a house, to
be paid into the papal treasury; for, said the Holy
Father, “all the islands on which Christ, the Sun of
justice, has shone belong to the see of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter.”
Henry’s victory over William of Scotland also gave
him the ascendency in that kingdom. Thus was
woven the substance of the band which now holds
together Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reign of Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> was brought to a close in
personal disaster. At Le Mans in France he was
beaten in battle by his son Richard, who, in conjunction
with King Philip Augustus, had raised an unfilial
hand against his father. Henry died, cursing God
and muttering, “Shame! shame on a conquered
king!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr> (Cœur de Lion) may be said to have
been badly born (September 8, 1157). His father,
Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, though astute in kingcraft, was among
the most disreputable of monarchs in personal character.
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bernard said of Henry, “He comes of the
devil, and to the devil he shall return.” His remorse
for the murder of Becket, which seems to have been
genuine, did not restrain him from spending his later
years as a notorious libertine, polluting every innocent
thing about him with his lecherous touch. Even
childhood was not safe from his lust. It is typical of
the man and the times that Geoffrey, for whom the
king secured the bishopric of Lincoln, was his own
natural son by Rosamond, his concubine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard’s mother, Eleanor, was perhaps of as unwholesome
a sort as his father. She never blushed
except at the failure of some intrigue which in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>later age is regarded as shameful to her sex. Her
first royal husband, Louis <abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr> of France, though
fascinated by her beauty, could not abide her infidelities,
and put her away. If the chronicle be true,
she avenged the marital sins of Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> by slaying
with her own hand his mistress, Rosamond.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard thus inherited much of the disposition
which marred his many nobler traits. Guizot’s portrait
of him is fair: “Beyond comparison the boldest,
the most unreflecting, the most passionate, the most
ruffianly, the most heroic adventurer of the middle
ages.” The first suggestion of his title, “Lion-hearted,”
is perhaps in the pages of Roger de Wendover (died
1237), who, describing the ravages Richard committed
in France, says: “He invaded the territory with more
than a lion’s fury, carried off the produce, cut down
the vines, burned the villages, and demolished everything.”
His first act upon coming to power was to
release his mother, Eleanor, from the twelve years’
imprisonment she suffered at the hands of her husband,
Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> Then was remembered, and applied
to her and to Richard, a prediction of Merlin, the
“Wizard of the North,” in the fifth century: “The
eagle of the broken treaty shall rejoice in her third
nestling.” Roger de Wendover thus interpreted the
hitherto enigmatic words: “The queen [Eleanor] is
meant by the eagle, because she stretches out her two
wings over two kingdoms, France and England. She
was separated from the king of the French by divorce
on account of consanguinity, and from the king of the
English by suspicion and imprisonment; and so she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>was on both sides the eagle of a broken treaty. ‘She
shall rejoice in her third nestling’ may be understood
in this way: the queen’s first-born son, named William,
died when he was a boy; Henry, her second
son, was raised to the rank of king, and paid the debt
of nature after he had engaged in hostilities with his
father; and Richard, her third son, who is denoted
by the ‘third nestling,’ was a source of joy to his
mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard was crowned September 11, 1189. Wendover,
who may have witnessed it, describes the
coronation service. Richard was conducted to Westminster
in solemn procession, headed by ecclesiastics
bearing the cross, holy water, and censers; four barons
carried candlesticks with wax candles, two earls holding
aloft two sceptres, one surmounted with a golden
cross, the other with a dove; three earls followed,
carrying three swords with golden sheaths; six earls
and barons carried a checker, over which were placed
the royal arms and robes, while a seventh held aloft
a golden crown. Richard swore upon the Gospels
his kingly devotion, pledging to observe peace, honor,
and reverence towards God and the holy church, and
to exercise true justice to all his people. “After this
they stripped him of all his clothes except his breeches
and shirt, which had been ripped apart over his shoulders
to receive the unction. He was then shod with
sandals interwoven with gold thread, and Baldwin,
Archbishop of Canterbury, anointed him king in three
places, namely, on his head, his shoulders, and his
right arm, using prayers composed for the occasion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Then a consecrated linen cloth was placed on his head,
over which was put a hat, and when they had again
clothed him in his royal robes, with the tunic and gown,
the archbishop gave into his hands a sword wherewith
to crush all the enemies of the church.... Then
they placed the crown upon his head, with the sceptre
in his right hand and the royal wand in his left.” Preceded
by candles and cross, he went to the celebration
of mass; thence “to the dinner-table, and feasted
splendidly, so that the wine flowed along the pavement
and walls of the palace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A very different scene, though not less characteristic
of the age, took place beyond the palace. Richard
had issued an edict forbidding any Jew to appear
at his coronation. Some of the wealthiest Hebrews,
presuming upon the splendid gifts they brought, approached
the dining-hall. The populace, willingly
interpreting the king’s mandate as a license for persecution,
set upon the Jews, not only at the palace
gate, but throughout the city. They murdered them
without stint and looted their houses. The king,
essaying an investigation, found that the chief dignitaries
and citizens were leaders of the mob, and
stayed further inquiry. Other cities emulated the
cruelty and greed of the Londoners. At York five
hundred Jews, who had fled for safety to the castle,
unable to defend themselves, slaughtered their own
wives and children to save them from worse fate,
threw the dead bodies to the Christians without the
walls, and then set fire to their refuge, perishing in
the flames. The people to whom the Jew’s had loaned
money, the bonds of which were kept in the cathedral,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>seized these evidences of debt and burned them
in pious offering before the altar.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief interest of Richard, even surpassing the
care of his throne, was to fulfil the vow he had taken
two years before (1187) to join a new crusade against
the Infidels in Palestine.</p>
<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE THIRD CRUSADE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='chap28' class='c008'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-eight'>XXVIII.</abbr> <br> WILLIAM OF TYRE—BARBAROSSA.</h3>
<p class='c006'>With the news of the fall of Jerusalem
came William, Archbishop of Tyre (the
chief chronicler for this time), to stir up
Europe to avenge the great disaster.
This man possessed powers of speech
equal to those of his pen. He appeared before an
assembly near Gisors, where were gathered the bravest
knights of England and France under their respective
kings, Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> and Philip Augustus. These
monarchs had laid aside the arms they were bearing
against each other, that they might hear the appeal to
holier warfare. The presence of such royalty did not
restrain the fiery and indignant eloquence of William
of Tyre. He cried, “To meet you here I have
traversed fields of carnage. But whose blood have
you been shedding? Why are you armed with these
swords? You are fighting here for the banks of a
river, for the limit of a province, for transient renown,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>while Infidels trample the banks of Siloam. Does
your Europe no longer produce warriors like Godfrey
and Tancred?” Even the blood of Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, poisoned
as it was with many sins, felt the ardor of the
appeal. He embraced his foe, Philip Augustus, with
tears, while they together put on the badge of the
cross. Princes and nobles followed the royal example,
foremost among them Richard, then Duke of Guienne.
Upon those who did not enlist was imposed a tax of
one tenth of the value of their property, to be annually
continued in a tenth of their incomes. This,
in attestation of the terror inspired by the arms of the
Saracen, was called “Saladin’s tithe.” The appeals
of William of Tyre were supported by the pastoral
letters of Pope Gregory <abbr title='the eighth'>VIII.</abbr>, which promised to all
who should “undertake the labor of this expedition ...
plenary indulgence for their offences and
eternal life; ... and no person is to make any
claim against the property of which, on assuming the
cross, they were in quiet possession; ... they are
not to pay interest to any person if they have so
bound themselves.” The Pope further ordered a
Lenten fast on every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday,
to appease the wrath of Heaven for sins, adding
that the papal household would also abstain from
flesh on Mondays.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire ritual of worship became infected with
militarism and fear of the common enemy beyond the
sea. In 1188 the Pope ordained that prayer against
the Saracens should be offered everywhere daily. In
the Church of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul a recognition of the distressful
condition was introduced into the liturgy. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Sundays there was read the psalm beginning, “Why
do the heathen rage?” On Mondays, “Save us, O
God, by Thy name.” On Tuesdays, “O God, why
hast Thou forsaken us?” On Wednesdays, “O God,
why hast Thou cast us off forever?” On Thursdays,
“O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance.”
On Fridays, “God standeth in the congregation
of the mighty.” On Saturdays, “O Lord God,
to whom vengeance belongeth, show Thyself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The peace between Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> and Philip Augustus
made under the crusader enthusiasm, like other sudden
excitements of religious emotion, did not long
continue. A believer in the doctrine of the perseverance
of the saints would hardly expect to find its
proof in the house of Anjou, save by its exceptions.
The recklessness of Richard again embroiled his father
and the French king in war. An attempt to restore
the truce on the same “sacred field” of Gisors where it
had been solemnly enacted failed, and Philip Augustus
cut down the elm-tree under which they had
sworn it, that nature might not taunt them with their
perjury. Saladin’s tithe was first devoted not against
the Infidels, but to the infidelity of Christians in warring
with one another, and was ominous of much of
the subsequent use of that treasure. Rome excommunicated
Richard, who drew his sword upon the
papal legate that announced to him the decree.
Philip as quickly repelled the interference of the
spiritual power with what he deemed the more sacred
right of conducting his own quarrels. It required the
opportune intervention of a thunder-storm to shake
the worldly purpose of Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, who, in genuine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>terror at the voice of heaven, at length agreed to
peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meanwhile William of Tyre had electrified
Germany with his appeals. The old emperor, Frederick <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr>,
took the cross, together with many of his
chief nobles, including his son, Frederick, Duke of
Swabia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frederick <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr>, called Barbarossa by his Italian
enemies because of his red beard, was the most
astute statesman, the most experienced general, and
the most powerful of the crowned heads of Europe
during the twelfth century. He had been thirty-seven
years on the throne of Germany. Though not
altogether successful in his strifes with the popes, he
had been able to consolidate his empire and extend
its prestige. Now, at sixty-seven years of age, the
peace of his dominion offered him the most envied
imperial honors and the quiet ending of his days; but
his heroic soul forgot the fatigue of age; he spurned
the enjoyments of his palace when he heard the call
for new adventures. He was the first <i>en route</i> for
Palestine; indeed, had completed his ill-fated expedition
before the younger princes of the West were
afield.</p>

<p class='c007'>The array of Frederick reflected the dignity of
its commander. It was under careful, even stringent
discipline; camp followers were unwelcome; no
women were allowed in the expedition. This was a
grievance to many of the fair sex, whose love would
have led them to accompany their husbands, or whose
adventurous instinct prompted them to put on armor;
but the order rid the army of the throng of immoral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>creatures who were accustomed to attach themselves
to the crusading masses. The usual crowd of paupers
who became soldiers only to better their condition,
and bands of pilgrims who sought safe convoy to the
sacred shrines, were ordered out of the ranks, only
those being allowed to start who showed possession
of sufficient money to maintain themselves for two
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>In true chivalric spirit, the veteran warrior of the
West sent to Saladin his royal challenge before proceeding
to battle. His letter was true to the times
also in that it showed the customary bravado of the
knight, entering the lists with self-laudation, and
hurling scorn at the visor of his antagonist. “We,
Frederick, by the grace of God, Emperor of the
Romans, ever August, the Magnificent Triumpher
over the enemies of the empire, to the Illustrious
Saladin, Governor of the Saracens.... Thou hast
profaned the Holy Land, over which we, by the
authority of the eternal King, bear rule.... God
willing, you shall learn by experience the might of
our victorious eagles.” Then Frederick lists the
nations in his following: “The towering Bavarian,
the cunning Swabian, the cautious Franconian, Saxony
that sports with the sword, the active Brabantine,
the Lorrainer, unused to peace, the fiery Burgundian,
the nimble mountaineer of the Alps, the
Friesian, with his javelin and thong, the Bohemian,
ever ready to brave death, Polonia, fiercer than her
own fierce beasts,” etc. “And, lastly, also, you shall
be taught how our own right hand, which you suppose
to be enfeebled by old age, can still wield the sword.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Saladin, in turn, outdid his challenger in courtesy
if not in bravado. “To the Great King, his sincere
friend, the Illustrious Frederick, ... in the name of
God the merciful.... You enumerate those who
are leagued with you, but if we wished to enumerate
those with us, the list could not be reduced to writing.
With us are the Bedouins, alone sufficient to
cope with you; the Turkomans, unaided able to destroy
you; our peasants, able to despoil and exterminate
you; the warlike Soldarii, by whom we have already
beaten you. These and all the kings of Islam
are with me; Babylon, with its dependencies, the land
of Damascus, and Jerusalem on the sea-coast, ...
and the land of Sudia, with its provinces. If you
wish for war, we will meet you in the power of the
Lord; but if you wish for peace, we will restore to
you the holy cross, and liberate all Christian captives,
and permit pilgrims to come freely and do them good.
And may Allah give us counsel!” A rumor was
current, based, doubtless, upon the clemency of Saladin
to the Christians, that he was himself contemplating
conversion to the faith of Europe. His letter
to Frederick was its sufficient refutation, even without
its closing invocation, “May God save our
Prophet, Mohammed!” He emulates the conceit
of his antagonist by signing himself, possibly with a
touch of sarcasm, “Saladin, Illustrious Lord, Victorious
King, Adorner of the standard of truth, Corrector
of the world,” etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>This seeming bombast was not peculiar to these
potentates. The Greek emperor, Isaac Angelus,
styled himself “The Most Sublime, Most Powerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Emperor, the Angel of the whole earth.” Isaac,
however, possessed no personal qualities worthy of
commendation. He inherited, together with the
conceit, the cowardice and treachery of the whole
line of Greek monarchs. He wrote to Frederick,
promising aid, and at the same time made alliance
with Saladin. Nicetas, the Greek historian of this
period, admits against his nation that Isaac broke the
treaties, impeded the roads, and diverted provisions
from his German allies. At Adrianople he laid ambush
for their scouts. The veteran Frederick, incensed
at this treatment, made a bloody retaliation
upon a detachment of Greeks. This brought Isaac
to terms. His friendship was measured by a flotilla
of fifteen hundred ships and twenty-six galleys, which
he prepared for the speedy transportation of the
Germans beyond the Marmora and out of menacing
distance of his capital.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kilidge-Arslan had sent fifty Moslem knights to
meet Frederick on the way, and to pledge his friendship,
but when the army reached Iconium it was discovered
that this had been only a device to delay the
emperor. Frederick taught the Moslems that he was in
no mood to be trifled with, by suddenly assaulting and
capturing the city. Pressing onward, the Germans
had daily to meet the guerilla attacks of the Infidels.
Their provisions were destroyed as fast as gathered.
Water was scarce, only the stagnant pools in fever-impregnated
marshes affording palliation to thirst.
The soldiers at times killed their horses and drank
their blood. Yet the discipline was strictly maintained.
No crime went unpunished. It was evident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>that a stronger hand was guiding the crusaders than
had before been felt. The Armenian patriarch wrote
to his friend Saladin, warning him of the extraordinary
type of man with whom he had to deal. Christian
and Turk awaited the issue of the campaign with
respective hope and solicitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of all obstacles, the Germans made a triumphant
march almost to the borders of Syria. The
pure water of the river Selef, which flows by the walls
of Seleucia, tempted the conqueror to bathe. Seized
with cramps, he was carried away by the hurrying
current. At length he was dragged from the water,
but was in dying condition. Tradition says that on
a rock near this spot was carved this prediction:
<span lang="la">“Hic hominum maximus peribit.”</span> If the omen be
fabulous, the description is correct, for Frederick Barbarossa
remains in history as one of the “greatest of
men.” William of Tyre, in his eulogy, translates his
spirit to heaven, while the Arabian historian, Omad,
tells us with equal confidence that the angel of death
carried his soul to hell.</p>

<p class='c007'>The German host, now led by the feebler hand of
his son, Frederick of Swabia, succeeded in reaching
Antioch with less than seven hundred horse and five
thousand foot, a retinue scarcely sufficient to do honor
to the remains of the grand old hero, which they
there buried in the Church of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter.</p>

<p class='c007'>In June, 1190, the English and French made preparation
to follow their unfortunate forerunner. It
was not, however, until a year later that they arrived
in Palestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The movements of Saladin, in the meanwhile, engrossed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the fears of the Christian world. After capturing
Jerusalem he attacked Tyre. The bravery of
the defence was supplemented by the timely arrival
of Conrad, whose father, the Marquis of Montferrat,
Saladin held prisoner. Conrad had already made his
name famous for valor. For his assistance of the
Greek emperor against seditions in Constantinople he
had won the title of Cæsar and the hand of the emperor’s
sister. Saladin endeavored to divert him by
threatening to kill his father unless he relinquished
the defence of Tyre. Conrad’s reply was noteworthy:
“The life of my father is less dear to me and to him
than the cause we both serve.” Saladin was forced
to give up the siege. He turned against Tripoli.
Aided by Admiral Margarit, whom the King of Sicily
had sent with a fleet and who had won the titles of
“King of the Sea” and the “New Neptune,” the
Tripolitans successfully resisted. Saladin then assailed
Carac, which was forced to yield to the Moslem
chief. He granted its defenders their liberty, and
restored to them their wives and children, whom, in
an hour of deathly fear, they had sold as slaves to
Saladin rather than see them the victims of such ravages
as usually followed the capture by the common
soldiery. King Guy of Jerusalem had been released
from imprisonment by Saladin on condition that he
would leave Palestine and return to Europe. Guy
paid no respect to his oath, but, gathering the loyal
remnant of his kingdom, laid siege to Ptolemaïs (Acre),
there inaugurating a contest which, for its duration and
the fame of the great chieftains engaged in it, was the
most noted in the sad annals of the third crusade.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>
  <h3 id='chap29' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-nine'>XXIX.</abbr> <br> SIEGE OF ACRE.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The plain of Acre is surrounded by great
natural defences. On the north is Mount
Saron, the narrow pathway over which is
called the “Ladder of Tyre”; on the
south rises the bulwark of Mount Carmel,
touching the sea; on the east lie the mountains of
Galilee; on the west the plain is washed by the
Mediterranean. Within this seemingly impregnable
district lay the strongly fortified city of Acre. Its
port rivalled those of Tyre, Sidon, and Jaffa. High
walls, guarded by deep moats, bent in shape of a
horseshoe from the crags on the north to a fortress
on the south, which rose from a rock in the waves.
With the water front these enclosed the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Into the plain beyond the wall Guy collected nine
thousand men. The rapid arrivals from Europe augmented
this force to eighty thousand, even before
the kings of England and France had started from
home. The Infidels already occupied the city, and
when Saladin seized the mountains about, the besiegers
were themselves besieged. By a sudden dash
Saladin penetrated their hosts, entered Acre, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>reconnoitred the Christian armies from the towers.
Conrad hastened from Tyre; two fleets brought new
bands of German and Danish crusaders. The Christians
gave battle, and drove the Moslems from the
field with such slaughter that Saladin was left almost
alone amid the wreck of his forces. But he quickly
recuperated his strength, and a few days later returned
the assault. No fury of fight could blind the eyes
of this commander. Ten times he cut through the
Christian lines, leading in person his swift riders. By
night the crusaders were driven back and huddled
impotently in their camps. The morrow revealed the
plain strewn with the débris of both armies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though Saladin had fully avenged his first discomfiture,
he had learned more of the sharpness of
the Christians’ swords, and was too wise to risk another
immediate engagement. He therefore withdrew
to his fastnesses in the rear of the Christian encampment.
During the entire winter (1189-90) the
Christians were unmolested, and prosecuted the siege
unremittingly. More than once the city barely escaped
becoming the prize of the Christians’ daring or
stratagem.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the spring (1190) Saladin returned. Every attack
made upon Acre by the crusaders was foiled by
a counter-attack by the Moslems upon their rear.
Egypt sent ships to succor the city, and Europe sent
ships to succor its soldiers. Masts bearing the cross
and those flying the pennant of its adversaries seemed
at times to be mingled in confusion over the bay. The
Moslem and Christian armies often manned their fortifications
and stood as spectators of naval duels, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>they were impotent to help their coreligionists. The
enthusiasm of the observers, not having sufficient expression
in shouts and cheers, often found vent in
supplementary fights in the field. In the battles
which raged on land the Christians were ordinarily
victors during the morning, the Saracens in the latter
part of the day. This was due, doubtless, to the
fact that the discipline of Saladin’s men was superior,
and that the self-command of their great general
patiently waited for the first ardor of the crusaders
to spend itself, or for their cupidity to divert their attention
from the foe to the plunder which they had
already taken.</p>

<p class='c007'>Saladin’s forces had been weakened at the time by
the ravages of Frederick Barbarossa in Asia Minor,
which we have described, and which drew off many
of the Moslem leaders to defend their own possessions
in that quarter. The Christians took advantage
of this to give the foe what they hoped to be a decisive
engagement. Their impetuosity could not be
resisted; they broke through even to the tent of Saladin.
As usual, they paused for the prey, and received
the usual punishment for their greed. Off guard,
they were massacred by thousands, even amid the
camps they were looting. An Arabian writer says:
“The Christians fell under the swords of the conquerors
as the wicked will fall into the abode of fire
at the last day. Nine ranks of dead covered the
ground, and each rank was of a thousand warriors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The besieged in Acre sallied forth and gave the
Christians a double defeat. Then came the news of
Frederick Barbarossa’s death. In the deep depression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>wrought by these tidings, a treaty of peace with
Saladin would doubtless have been at once concluded,
had not the Christians’ spirit been raised by the
timely arrival of European fleets. Frederick of
Swabia’s appearance with the remnant of his father’s
army was signalled by new adventures, only to be
met with new failures. The Christians, having no
support from the surrounding country, were reduced
almost to starvation, feeding upon horses and making
soup of their harness. The plain, inundated by the
overflowing river, bred epidemic, which carried away
multitudes, three or four hundred being buried daily.
Frederick of Swabia, the heir of the German throne,
sickened and passed away, and many of his men returned
to the West.</p>

<p class='c007'>Queen Sibylla of Jerusalem also died at this juncture,
and the Christians were divided into the hostile
camps of those who were seeking to possess themselves
of the shadows of the kingship. Humphrey
had married Sibylla’s sister, and put forth his claim
to the throne. Conrad gained the favor of the
bishop, who forcibly dissolved Humphrey’s marriage
and gave his wife to Conrad, though that worthy had
already a spouse, the sister of the Greek emperor.
King Guy, however, maintained his own rights to
the empty sceptre. A civil war, which would surely
have brought the Christian cause to ruin, was diverted
only by the expected arrival of the kings of England
and France, to whom it was agreed that the dispute
should be referred.</p>

  <h3 id='chap30' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirty'>XXX.</abbr> <br> THE COMING OF PHILIP AUGUSTUS AND RICHARD—FALL OF ACRE.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Richard <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr> was crowned King of England
in September, 1189. In October
there arrived in England a messenger
from Philip of France, reminding the king
of their mutual oaths to make the crusade.
The adventurous spirit of Richard did not need this
appeal. He drained the resources of his realm in
gathering means. All the money left him by his
father, Henry <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, was first appropriated. He then
sold the manors and prospective income of the crown.
Next the chief offices of honor and responsibility
went to the highest bidder who had ready cash.
Thus Hugh de Puzas, Bishop of Durham, became
chief justice of England for a thousand marks. Having
abundant soldiery at his command, Richard then
allowed any one to purchase the privilege of staying
at home; he even declared that he would sell the
City of London for a reasonable price. The vassalage
of Scotland went for a thousand marks, together
with the fortresses of Roxburgh and Berwick.
When he had nothing more to sell he forced his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>richer subjects to make him loans, which they knew
he never would repay. A plain-spoken preacher advised
him, before he set out on an expedition in the
name of religion, to dispose of some of his notorious
vices, naming especially his pride, avarice, and voluptuousness.
Richard replied, “You counsel well, and
I hereby dispose of the first to the Templars, of the
second to the Benedictine monks, and of the third to
my prelates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Consigning the administration of England to Hugh,
Bishop of Durham, and an unsavory Frenchman,
Longchamp, Bishop of Ely, he left England, accompanied
by a turbulent crowd of adventurers. He
made his rendezvous with the French king at Vezelay
(June, 1190). Here the monarchs swore fraternity
and to sacredly respect each other’s domains
during the crusade. They invoked upon themselves
the curses of Heaven and the church if they should
prove unfaithful. The joint armies numbered a hundred
thousand men. Warned by the reverses experienced
by their predecessors in crusading overland,
they chose the sea route to Palestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Philip sailed from Genoa for Sicily. He entered
the port of Messina, September 16, 1190. Richard
sailed from Marseilles, hugging the Italian coast, according
to the sea travel of the day, visiting port
towns <i>en route</i>, and paying worship at the shrines of
the various local saints. He reached Messina a few
days later than Philip (September <abbr title='twenty-third'>23d</abbr>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The main English fleet, leaving England and Normandy,
had gone southward along the coast of France
and Spain. The lands they passed in sight of were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>strange to the navigators, so little was known of the
geography of even the countries of Europe. At Lisbon
they could not resist the temptation to help the
Portuguese Christians in a war with the Saracens,
nor of indulging a less laudable sort of prowess,
which Hovenden describes: “Disembarking from
their ships, they made their way into the city, and as
they went through streets and lanes talked to the
people, giving themselves airs and committing violence
upon the wives and daughters of the citizens;
they drove away pagans and Jews, plundered their
property, and burned their houses. They then
stripped their vineyards, leaving them not so much
as a grape.” This faithful chronicler also narrates
that during a storm at sea <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Thomas à Becket
appeared to them and calmed the waves. “They
passed the city of Silva(?), which was the most remote
of all the cities of Christendom.” At Marseilles
they missed King Richard, who already had
departed; but they were compensated for their
disappointment in being enabled to worship the
identical “rods with which our Lord was scourged,
the jaw-bone of Lazarus, and one of the ribs of
Lawrence.” Approaching Sicily, they saw the marvellous
fish of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Agatha, the story of which they
believed: how that the heat of the volcano of Mount
Gebel (Stromboli?) once threatened the town of Catana;
but the people took the veil of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Agatha from
her tomb, “carried it before them, facing the fire, on
which the flames returned to the sea and, parching
it, dried it up for nearly a mile, and scorched the
fish, many of which were half burned; and there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>to this day many fish there of the same kind.” But
the marvels of that voyage are too many for our
pages, if not for the credulity of the reader.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard himself remained six months in Marseilles,
a delay that nearly caused the destruction of his enterprise.
A quarrel was started with Tancred, ruler
of Sicily, about certain rights of Richard’s sister Joanna,
who was the widow of Tancred’s predecessor.
Says the chronicler: “Quicker than priest could chant
matins did King Richard take the city.” Philip resented
Richard’s audacity and forced him to take
down his standard. Richard had once solicited and
gained from Philip the hand of the French princess
Alice; but, his advantage now blowing from another
direction, he preferred Berengaria, a princess of Navarre.
Berengaria, through the connivance of Eleanor,
was brought to Messina. Only at the entreaty
of utmost piety and discretion could Philip be persuaded
to lay aside his rage at this new insult. He
sailed at once for the East.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard followed eleven days later (April, 1191),
taking with him Berengaria and Joanna, ex-Queen
of Sicily. Three ships of the English fleet were
wrecked on Cyprus, and their crews imprisoned by
the inhabitants. Isaac, the king of the island, refused
to redress the wrong. Richard administered swift
punishment. Within three weeks he conquered the
entire country, and, binding its ruler in a chain of
silver, took him along on an involuntary pilgrimage
to Palestine. Richard had celebrated his prowess at
Cyprus by his nuptials with Berengaria. The new
queen took with her as companion the daughter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Isaac, whose constant presence is said to have disturbed
the already uncertain marital habits of her
husband.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French welcomed the arrival of their English
allies with great bonfires, which were designed to
proclaim the joy of the Christians and to flash dismay
to the Moslem camps. The plain of Acre was
soon filled with the tents of a host which represented
the strength of combined Europe. Peoples strange
to one another in speech, manners, and arms were
one only in their cause. It is not to be wondered at
if, at times, these races more sharply accentuated their
differences than their unity. The contention between
Guy and Conrad for the kingship of Jerusalem, which
was referred to Philip and Richard for settlement,
only gave opportunity for renewed hostility between
these monarchs, Philip declaring for Conrad, and
Richard for Guy. The matter was finally settled by
agreement that Guy should reign and that Conrad
should be his successor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jealousy of French and English prevented
mutual help in the battles daily occurring, wherefore
it was agreed that but one army should fight at a
time against the walls of Acre, while the other should
guard against a rear attack by Saladin. Thus the
honors were easy, as the tasks assigned were equally
hazardous. The courtesies of the camp were more
readily extended to their enemy than to one another.
Saladin, during the sickness of both sovereigns, sent
to them his own physicians, and such luxuries as the
East provided. While they received these from their
foe without suspicion, Philip and Richard each attributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>his sickness to the poisoning of the other, and
each accused his Christian associate with using Saladin’s
favors with a view to treasonable alliance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Often tournaments were arranged between Moslem
and Christian in the sight of both armies. Knight
and emir entered the lists, abusing each other with
their tongues like twin Thersiteses, then fighting with
the valor of Hector and Achilles. Women did not
disdain rivalry for the palm in swordcraft, and bands
of children from either side fought to the death in the
presence of their parents. The Infidel played for the
dance of the Christian, and the minstrel of Europe
gave the rhythm to the feet of the Saracen. The
table of Saladin was sometimes graced by the presence
of the foremost European knights, and in turn emirs
feasted at the board of those whom they most dreaded
to meet on the field. Saladin so respected the courtesy
and devotion of the true Christian knight that
he willingly wore the decoration of Chivalry, while
Richard rode into battle one of the two splendid
steeds which were the gift of the sultan’s brother.
The lowest vices of the East and the West became the
open indulgence of the camps of both. But each
party maintained the utmost outward reverence to
the symbols of his own religion; Saladin pausing in
the midst of battle to read a chapter of the Koran,
and the King of Jerusalem advancing to fight with
the Gospels borne aloft before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The besieged in Acre were reduced to extremities,
the Christians completely investing the city on the
land side in spite of the forays of Saladin from the
hills, and their fleets cutting off all succor from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>sea. At length, after two years of incessant fighting,
during which nine great battles were fought, the
standard of the cross was seen floating from the ramparts
of the city (July 12, 1191). The besieged had
capitulated upon condition that their lives should be
spared, and that Saladin should pay their ransom in
two hundred pieces of gold. In the original proposal
it was agreed to surrender the wood of the True Cross,
the possession of which by the Infidels was imagined
to be the cause of all sorts of disasters to the Christian
world; among the least of which, if we are to
believe a chronicler of the time, was that all children
born in Christendom since the capture of the cross at
Hattîn had but twenty-two instead of thirty-two
teeth. Richard was not religious enough to insist
upon the restoration of this precious symbol.</p>

<p class='c007'>Saladin, after the city had fallen, delayed in fulfilling
the condition that the defenders of Acre had
put upon him relative to their ransom money. Richard
avenged this assumed breach of faith by massacring
five thousand unarmed Moslems before the city
wall. Philip, in disgust at this action, turned over
his army to the Duke of Burgundy and returned to
France.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard, thus left in sole command, crossed Mount
Carmel and proceeded southward, keeping close to
the shore that he might have timely assistance from
his fleet. At every stream and sand-dune he met
the omnipresent Saladin. The Christians’ march was
under an incessant rain of arrows, which covered the
frequent dashes of the Moslem squadrons. At the
banks of the Arsur (Nahr Falik) the Christians encountered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the entire army of their contestants (September
7, 1191). Though Richard led sixty thousand,
the Oriental historian Omad, secretary to Saladin,
says that the Mussulmans surrounded them as
the eyelashes surround the eye. The cry “Allah!
Allah!” was echoed by “Deus vult!” as the mighty
hosts sprang upon each other. The Christian infantry,
leading the assault, suddenly opened its ranks; the
cavalry poured through and made the first attack.
Richard followed with the main body. Nothing could
withstand the fury of his onset. The Moslems were
swept before him; but they as quickly gathered in
his rear, compelling him to return and fight over
again the battle he had already won. The plain was
too small for the multitude to marshal in orderly array.
The armies were intertwined as the many folds
of two serpents of hostile breed. It is said that more
than once Richard and Saladin tested each other’s
qualities by personal encounter; the only doubt cast
upon this story by Christian writers being from the
fact that Saladin survived, the Arabic chroniclers rejecting
it on the ground that Richard still lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>At nightfall the Moslems extricated themselves
from the mêlée and disappeared in the forests of
Saron, the Christians being wary enough not to follow
them. Had Richard pursued his advantage the
Arabian historians admit that he might have secured
Jerusalem; but the impulsive temper of this leader
suffered from sudden reaction. He repaired to Jaffa
with the women of his household, and there established
a brilliant and festive court. One day while
hunting he was surrounded by a troop of Moslems.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>When he was on the point of being captured a French
knight cried out, “I am the king; spare me.” The
Moslems, thus diverted, allowed Richard to escape,
and brought the knight a captive to Saladin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard soon tired of his rest, and even of revelry,
at Jaffa, and projected the siege of Ascalon. Saladin,
made aware of that enterprise, burned the city.
Richard set about its rebuilding; his orders were
disobeyed. Many echoed the words of Leopold of
Austria, who declared that he was a warrior, but
neither a carpenter nor a mason.</p>

<p class='c007'>The resentment of this prince had been kindled
against the Englishman by an outrage on the part of
Richard in ordering the standard of Austria to be
thrown from the walls of Acre, where Leopold had
presumptuously planted it after the capture of that
place. Conrad of Montferrat had also taken umbrage
at Richard’s lordly treatment of him, and was detected
in courting alliance with Saladin for the restitution
of Acre. Richard foiled him with deeper play.
He proposed to give his sister, the ex-Queen of Sicily,
as wife to Malek-Ahdel, brother of Saladin, that
there might be erected at Jerusalem a mongrel empire
of Christians and Moslems. Saladin toyed with
the proposition sufficiently to delay Richard’s attack
upon Jerusalem until that city had been greatly
strengthened. Thousands of Christian captives were
set to work upon the walls and in the ditches, under
threat of being massacred, as were the Moslems by
Richard’s order at Acre. Realizing that his scheme
of alliance with Saladin had failed, Richard endeavored
to engage his antagonist in battle in the open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>country; but the astute Moslem was too discreet to
risk his cimeters against heavy swords, except when
necessary. He had also some less martial schemes
on foot; he seduced Conrad at least from whole-hearted
loyalty to the cross, by promising to defend
him in permanent possession of whatever cities he
might take from his fellow-Christians. Conrad was
soon assassinated by two Moslems. Richard was
quickly accused of being accessory to this deed. The
suspicion grew in plausibility when he forced Isabella,
widow of Conrad, to marry his nephew, the
Count of Champagne, who thus, through Isabella’s
rights as sister of Sibylla, became titular King of
Jerusalem. King Guy was compensated for the loss
of his throne by the gift of the government of Cyprus,
where his descendants reigned for two hundred years,
until the Moslem wave had ingulfed the entire eastern
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c007'>Saladin was also thought to have connived at the
murder of Conrad. One of the murderers, however,
confessed to having been the agent of the Old Man
of the Mountain, the chief of the sect of Assassins,
who also avowed himself responsible for the deed.</p>

<p class='c007'>This sect, whose name has given to European
languages their word for the most atrocious crime, is
one of the many divisions of the Moslem peoples.
Their sheik regarded himself as the lineal successor of
Hassan, and thus the inheritor of the Imam or Holy
Spirit, whose possession is the inner sign of the caliphate.
Hassan, after various adventures, retired to
Altamont, a strong castle in the mountains of Persia,
whence his title, and that of his successors, of “Old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Man of the Mountain.” He attempted to enforce his
spiritual authority by inspiring universal dread of his
vengeance. His successors and agents became adept
in the use of poisons, the dagger, and all methods
of secretly disposing of human life. So wide were
the ramifications of this brotherhood that, not only
throughout the Moslem world, but in Christian Europe,
sudden death, otherwise unaccountable, was
accredited to the Assassins, whose dusky forms were
imagined to move unseen in the bedchambers of
princes and to stand behind thrones. The name
“Assassin” is apparently from “hashish,” the drug
with which the murderer stimulated his courage when
accepting the desperate commission from his chief.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard, thus relieved of his rival, Conrad, again
showed his superior powers of command. With
marvellous celerity he swept over the country, even
to the southern extreme of Palestine, where he captured
Dârôm, at the entrance to Egypt. Saladin was
apparently forced to retire within the walls of Jerusalem.
Richard pressed towards the sacred city
(June, 1192). Rumors of Saracen destitution and
fright came upon every wind. The crusaders were
eager to pluck again the prize of Jerusalem, which
Providence seemed to hang within their reach; but
Richard was incredulous of the weakness of a foe he
had always found as strong as himself, and whom he
knew to be his superior in craft. He pointed out to
his followers that at that very moment the Moslem
armies, scattered everywhere among the Judean
foot-hills, actually surrounded their own; that the
roads to the city were in places but narrow defiles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>guarded by precipitous heights, from which a few
could hurl destruction upon many. To carry siege
apparatus through such a country, facing the menace
of a Saladin, was to invoke certain disaster. If repulse
should come, what relief could they find so far
away from the coast? How could they ever hope to
make good a retreat to their ships?</p>

<p class='c007'>The council of knights to whom the matter was
referred agreed with their chief. Richard, with undoubted
affliction of his martial pride, if not of his
pious spirit, gave one longing look towards the distant
domes of Jerusalem. He then covered his face
with his shield and turned away, declaring that he
was unwilling to gaze upon that which he was unable
to conquer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The retreat from Jerusalem destroyed Richard’s
prestige as a strategist and capable leader of great
enterprises; but nothing ever lessened his lustre for
personal bravery. The lion may be outwitted by the
fox; and it is no deep disgrace to Cœur de Lion that
he could not circumvent a Saladin. Richard vented
his disappointment and rage upon many parts of the
Moslem host. Like a wounded lion, he destroyed
whatever came within his reach. One day he annihilated
a squadron of seven thousand Infidels; another
time he captured as many camels laden with provision.</p>

<p class='c007'>Saladin had outgeneralled him at Jaffa and captured
that city, with the exception of the citadel, which
promised surrender if succor did not come within a
day. Richard in turn outplayed his rival; he slipped
from the harbor of Acre with a few galleys and surprised
the garrison at Jaffa. Such was the celerity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>of his approach that the Moslems fled from the city
without having time to strike another blow in its
defence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having obtained all the glory that was possible
from his Eastern adventure, Richard proposed peace
with Saladin. His emirs, equally wearied with war,
urged the reluctant Saladin to accede to the crusaders’
terms. These were that the Christians should
possess all the coast, except Ascalon, which should
remain unoccupied, and that Jerusalem should be
free for the feet of all pilgrims. The compact was
made in the presence of the Koran and the Bible, the
silent witnesses of the oaths taken respectively in the
names of Allah and Jehovah. It was to be faithfully
observed, according to some chroniclers, for the space
of three years, three months, three weeks, three days,
and three hours—a suggestion that came from the
crusaders’ reverence for the Trinity. The peace was
celebrated by a friendly tournament between chosen
Christian and Moslem champions, in which lances
clave through armor and swords drew life-blood in
mere play. The gates of Jerusalem were thrown
open that the warriors of the cross might kneel at the
spot where the symbol of their faith had stood when
their God hung upon it, and so return to Europe
having accomplished a holy pilgrimage, if not a successful
warfare.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus ended the third crusade, marked by the loss
of perhaps a half-million Europeans, the foremost of
emperors, an inestimable amount of treasure, and the
prestige of Christendom as against the onrolling power
of the Moslem world.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Richard returned to Europe (October 9, 1192).
He was led to this purpose not more by his evident
inability to found a kingdom in Palestine than by the
necessity of maintaining his kingdom at home. Philip
Augustus was menacing his domain. When this
fellow-crusader left Palestine he renewed his oath
with Richard not to commence any hostilities against
him during his absence. It is said that he applied
to the Pope for a dispensation from this vow. If this
was not so, his actions showed that its restrictions
were irksome to him. Longchamp, whom Richard
had left in charge of the English government conjointly
with the Bishop of Durham, endeavored to
exercise limitless control. Even the mandates of
Richard were disregarded by him. Compelled to
flee the country, Longchamp became the open promoter
of Philip’s designs. Philip made war upon
Richard’s possessions in Normandy, and seduced from
his allegiance Prince John, the king’s younger brother,
destined to be his successor on the throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard, not daring to pass through France lest
Philip should lay violent hands upon his person, sailed
up the Adriatic. He was shipwrecked near Aquileia,
and in disguise made his way northward through
Austria. But no need of caution could restrain the
impulsiveness of Richard, either in war or in pleasure.
Dressed as a pilgrim, he lived as a prince; his prodigality
easily led to his identification. Duke Leopold
of Austria, whose banner he had thrown into
the ditch at Acre, now took occasion to avenge that
insult. He arrested Richard and threw him into
prison (1193). The German emperor, Henry <abbr title='the sixth'>VI.</abbr>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>also claimed the royal captive, and secured his person
by paying to Leopold sixty thousand pieces of silver.
The chronicler remarks, in the spirit of that age:
“Forewarnings of this calamity had appeared in
unusual seasons, inundations of rivers, awful storms
of thunder and rain, with dreadful lightning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>England, through Richard’s mother, Eleanor, appealed
in vain to the Pope to intervene, inasmuch as
the holy see had guaranteed the humblest—and surely
the noblest—crusader against any detriment from
Christians. But the priests of Rome were politicians,
and made no sign. Philip of France, now in league
with Prince John, and relieved of his dread of Richard,
boldly made war in Normandy, where, however,
he was repulsed by Robert of Leicester, a crusader
who, more fortunate than his king, had reached home.
Prince John also made an unsuccessful attempt to
seat himself on his brother’s throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meanwhile Richard chafed in a dungeon
where he was loaded with irons. His perpetual incarceration,
or his assassination, being fraught with
too much danger to his captors, it was determined to
bring him to judicial disgrace. He was therefore
summoned before the Diet of the Empire at Worms,
and formally accused of crimes of all sorts, such as
having insulted the Duke of Austria, having assassinated
Conrad of Montferrat, having concluded a disgraceful
treaty with Saladin. The royal captive, with
marvellous self-restraint for him, deigned to explain
these matters; then he burst out into indignant denunciation
of his captors. The princes of Germany
were made ashamed of the ignominy that in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>name had been thrust upon the foremost hero of the
age. Even prelates at length remembered that Richard
had remained alone in Palestine when others were
wearied with the defence of the faith.</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry <abbr title='the sixth'>VI.</abbr> was forced to release his royal captive.
Yet he managed to fix as his ransom a hundred and
fifty thousand marks. This large amount it was difficult
to raise. The churches of England melted their
plate; prelates paid a fourth of their income, the lower
clergy a tenth, and all ranks a commensurate tax.
Queen Eleanor in person bore the sum thus collected
to Mayence (1194). Henry, however, could not yet
brook his victim’s escape. Having received the ransom,
he ordered Richard’s rearrest; but the English
ship that bore him slipped from the mouth of the
Schelde before the officers could overtake it. Philip
of France sent this ungraceful but timely warning to
Prince John: “Take care of yourself; the devil is
broken loose.” One chronicler notes that at the very
hour in which the king landed in England there
appeared “a brilliant and unusual splendor in the
heavens, of a very white and red color, about the
length and breadth of a human body.” He also observes
that Duke Leopold of Austria was horribly
punished for his cruelty to Richard. Infernal fires
were kindled in his limbs, whose progress he in vain
tried to stay by amputating his own foot with an axe,
and at length expired in dreadful agony. Romance
has invented a pleasing story of Blondel, Richard’s
friend and minstrel, who discovered the place of his
king’s imprisonment by singing in its proximity a
familiar song, to which Richard responded. It is true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>to the times, but the historian cannot vouch for its
basis in fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Richard reached his throne his great competitor
for renown in arms, Saladin, had passed away
(March, 1193). He had retired to Damascus. A
year after the peace, feeling the approach of the last
enemy, and realizing that a greater than Richard was
upon him, he ordered that his burial shroud, instead
of his usual standard, should be carried through all
the streets of Damascus, while his herald cried, “This—this
is all that remains of the glory of Saladin, who
conquered the East.”</p>

  <h3 id='chap31' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirty-one'>XXXI.</abbr> <br> PALESTINE AFTER THE THIRD CRUSADE—HENRY VI.—SIEGE OF THORON.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>After the death of Saladin his empire
fell to pieces. Afdhal, his eldest son, secured
the title of Sultan of Damascus;
another son, Aziz, that of Sultan of
Egypt; and a third, Dahir, that of Sultan
of Aleppo; Malek-Ahdel, his brother, the rule over
Mesopotamia. Afdhal warred upon Aziz, and Malek-Ahdel
took advantage of the reverses of both.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Christians also fought among themselves. The
jealousies of Templars and Hospitallers were intense.
These two orders had, since their founding early in
the century, grown to be powerful organizations, not
only in Palestine, but throughout Europe. They
held valuable property in all lands. Princes, feudal
lords, and high dignitaries of the church were enrolled
in their membership. They were rivals everywhere
for the repute of bravery, as well as in wealth
and political influence. The Roman see exempted
their members from secular taxation, and even from
religious oversight, except by the Holy Father himself.
Their grand masters were autocratic sovereigns within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>their orders. Naturally they became overbearing,
intolerant of interference, amenable to no counsel but
their own. Their power bred audacity, and ecclesiastical
privileges fostered the conceit of saintship,
which even their crimes could not tarnish. As they
despised the rest of mankind, so the two orders hated
each other as rivals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Pope appealed for a new crusade, but could
not evoke any popular response. Richard of England
and Philip of France had such mutual suspicion
that neither would leave his domain to the depredations
of the other; and they hated each other too
cordially to again unite their arms in the common
cause. A few listened to the Pope’s appeal, among
them Simon de Montfort, afterwards known for his
butchery of the Albigenses.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was reserved for Henry <abbr title='the sixth'>VI.</abbr>, the contemptible
persecutor of Richard, to represent the royalty of
Europe in response to the call of the Holy Father.
He emulated the fame of his father, Frederick Barbarossa,
whose ambition he inherited with neither his
character nor ability. Not content with issuing royal
mandates, he himself became a preacher of the holy
war (spring of 1195). An army under the Archbishop
of Mayence, which was joined by Queen
Margaret of Hungary, moved eastward by way of
the Danube. Another, under the dukes of Saxony
and Brabant, left the ports of the Baltic. Henry
marched with a force for Italy, but had his eye rather
on Sicily than Palestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first army reached Acre, and began ravaging
the Moslem lands in spite of the protests of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Christian inhabitants, who could not bring themselves
to so shameful a breach of treaty. Instantly the divisions
of the Infidels were healed. From Egypt,
Damascus, and Mesopotamia, the Moslems rallied to
Jerusalem. Assigning command to Malek-Ahdel,
they took summary vengeance upon the invaders.
Jaffa fell at once into their hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second army of Christians, having made the
voyage down the Atlantic and through the Mediterranean,
landed at Beirut and inflicted a crushing
defeat upon Malek-Ahdel, who had advanced from
Jaffa to oppose its progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry <abbr title='the sixth'>VI.</abbr> busied himself in Sicily until he had
secured that country, and with it restored the imperial
preponderance in the affairs of Italy. This he
accomplished through the perpetration of barbarities
from which the Turks would have recoiled, and in
which the Greeks at Constantinople were his only
competitors. He put out the eyes of the son of
Tancred, ruler of Cyprus, and stole his daughters.
With the instinct of a ghoul, he dug up the body of
Tancred in order to strip from it the badge of dead
royalty. When he had satisfied his remorseless
ambition in this section, he allowed the remnant of
his army to proceed to Palestine for the succor of
their brethren. He engaged to keep a force of fifty
thousand in the Holy Land for one year at his own
expense. The third army was led by Conrad, Bishop
of Hildesheim, chancellor of the empire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus augmented, the Christians in the East were
enthusiastic for the recapture of Jerusalem; but the
coming of winter, the well-known strengthening of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the fortifications about the Holy City, and, above all,
the dissensions among the rival leaders, who cared
more for the maritime cities, with their treasures, than
for a place whose chief glory was its sacredness, led
to the postponement of the enterprise until the spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>An assault upon Thoron occupied them meanwhile.
The fortress of Thoron, between the Lebanons and
the Mediterranean, was the great menace to the ambition
of the invaders. This stronghold was on the
top of a mountain, and guarded from hostile approach
by precipitous walls and deep ravines. Its seeming
impregnability did not daunt the spirit of the crusaders;
they bridged chasms and dug into cliffs, until
they thoroughly undermined the masonry of the
fortress.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moslems, realizing their extremity, proposed
to capitulate on simply being guaranteed their lives.
The proposition divided the Christian leaders, the
majority being willing to accept this condition of
surrender; but many, overcome by their passion for
blood, voted to give no quarter. The attitude of
this latter party in the conference convinced the
Moslem deputies that the lives of their people would
not be safe even under the sacredness of an agreement,
an impression which was confirmed by the
remembrance of past occasions when the Christians
won the name of truce-breakers. Believing that they
had nothing to hope for, the Moslems resolved to
fight it out. In vain did the more moderate among
the besiegers assure them of protection. The broken
ramparts were repaired, or the gaps filled with solid
ranks of soldiers who with upraised swords invoked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>the judgment of Allah. They countermined, and met
their assailants in subterranean passages. The Saxon
miners who entered these shafts often reappeared in
the hands of captors upon the walls, whence they were
hurled by the engines through the air, to fall dead in
the camp they had left. The desperate valor of the
Moslems depressed the hosts which but yesterday
were waiting to bathe their victorious swords in the
blood of the victims. The chiefs accused one another
of cowardice and treachery. The miserable rivalry
led them one by one to desert and retire to the coast.
One day, when the orders for general assault had
been issued, the various divisions found themselves
without leaders and without plans. Disorder was
followed by panic, augmented by the report that
Malek-Ahdel had been joined by Aziz, the son of
Saladin and Sultan of Egypt, and that soon this force
would be upon them. A furious tempest swept over
the mountain. Their superstition heard in the thunders
the malediction of heaven, and saw in the freshets
which obliterated the paths the vengeance of nature
for their having turned aside from the conquest of
Jerusalem. The Germans made a wretched flight
for Jaffa; the Syrian Christians huddled themselves
into Acre. Malek-Ahdel quickly assaulted Jaffa, and,
though repulsed, left the dukes of Saxony and Brabant
dead upon the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>News soon came of the death of the Emperor
Henry <abbr title='the sixth'>VI.</abbr> (September 28, 1197). The German
chieftains hastened their return to Europe in order
to secure their individual interests with the successor
to the imperial throne. In vain did the Pope protest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>against the desertion of the pious cause. A woman,
Queen Margaret of Hungary, alone remained with
her soldiers on the sacred soil. The remnant left at
Jaffa were surprised during a roisterous and drunken
celebration of the feast of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Martin, and were massacred
almost to a man by the Moslems.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus terminated what some writers denominate
the fourth crusade, but which surely deserves no such
designation. It was a European raid in which the
religious motive scarcely evidenced itself except in
the fact that it was proclaimed by a Pope. The thirty
ounces of gold which Henry <abbr title='the sixth'>VI.</abbr> promised to each of
his soldiers seem to have been more influential over
their minds than even the desire to pray at the Holy
Sepulchre. The movement inspired new confidence
in the prowess of the Moslems, confirming their own
belief in the invincibility of their Prophet, and exciting
a query throughout the Christian world, if Christ
had not deserted His people because of their sins.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE FOURTH CRUSADE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='chap32' class='c008'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirty-two'>XXXII.</abbr> <br> HISTORY AND CONDITION OF CONSTANTINOPLE.</h3>
<p class='c006'>In the year 395 the Roman world was divided
into the empires of the East and
the West, and Constantinople became the
rival capital of that on the Tiber. Eighty-one
years later (476) Odoacer, the barbarian,
sacked Rome and brought to an end the Western
Empire, from which time Constantinople claimed the
sole heirship to the power of the Cæsars. In 800
Charlemagne reëstablished the imperial power in
western Europe, but within fifty years it again fell to
pieces in the hands of his less puissant sons. The
Greek emperors and people assumed the title of
Romans. Their capital was called New Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>There had occurred a similar breach between the
Roman and Greek churches. A doctrinal divergence
had assumed irreconcilable proportions in the sixth
century. The controversy centred chiefly in the question
of whether the Holy Spirit proceeded equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>from the Father and the Son, or solely from the
Father; the Roman Church maintaining the former
dogma, as expressed by the addition of the word
“Filioque” to the Nicene Creed, the Greek Church
repudiating it. Many minor differences of doctrine
and discipline were also generated. Ecclesiastical
separation followed. After generations of wrangling,
the Pope’s legates shook the dust from their feet and
departed from Constantinople, leaving on the altar of
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Sophia a writ of excommunication and anathema.
Thus the last tie between the two peoples was sundered.</p>

<p class='c007'>From 867 to 1057 the Basilian dynasty steadily
compacted the power, developed the governmental
system, augmented the wealth, and extended the area
of the Greek empire. From 1057, however, under
the dynasty of the Comneni, Greek prestige has
steadily declined. The strength of its dominion had
been largely due to the preservation of a municipal
and provincial spirit, a virtual independence of its
various communities, each seeking its own welfare,
while all maintained their loyalty to the central authority.
Under the later Basilians ambitious emperors
adopted the policy of absorbing all the local rights
into their personal control. The Comneni continued
this fatal policy, but their hands were not strong
enough to retain what they had grasped. The occupants
of the Greek throne were weak men. The
names of Isaac, Michael, Nicephorus, and Alexius
are those of pygmies compared with the German
emperors and the popes of the eleventh and twelfth
centuries. Indeed, in the East the art of statesmanship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>had been lost. The rulers of Constantinople were
intriguers, not diplomats. With them dissimulation
took the place of caution, trickery that of courage,
and prosperity was measured only by the number
and value of the royal perquisites. The Oriental
practice of farming the revenue was the easiest
method of obtaining income. He was regarded as
the wisest administrator who squeezed the largest
amount from the unwilling people. Officers were
commissioned without salary or even provision for
their expenses, it being expected that they would
first of all feather their own nests. Even an emperor
is accused of fitting out vessels for piracy upon his
own seas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The personal character of the later Greek monarchs
was equally despicable with their system of government.
Alexius Comnenus spent his time in play.
Andronicus was chiefly renowned for the magnificence
of his horse-shows, attendance at which was
varied by drunken debauches and acts of cowardly
cruelty. Isaac was noted for the wasteful extravagance
of his table, the frequent changes of his apparel,
and the peacock magnificence of his public appearances.
It is said that madmen were held in honor
as being under the special direction of Heaven, and it
would seem from their conduct that the emperors were
ambitious to secure this sole mark of the divine favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such rulers, having lost the respect, could not hold
the loyalty of their subjects. The people no longer
responded to the calls of the throne for aid in the
war-fields. Indeed, the independent peasant class,
having been reduced to virtual slavery, were more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>ready to admit a change of rulers than to risk their
lives for the support of such as they had. The emperors
were thus compelled to surround themselves
with mercenaries whom they hired in foreign countries.
Slavonians, Italians, Warings (Saxons who
were crowded out of England by the recent Norman
conquest), filled the armies and oppressed the citizens.
The Greek navy was composed chiefly of Venetian
bottoms, and manned by water-dogs from every
seaport in Europe. To these elements of decrepitude
we must add the ceaseless strife for occupancy of the
imperial throne. During the quarter-century ending
with 1200 there were more claimants than there were
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>This internal weakness of the Byzantine or Greek
empire left it largely the prey of enemies from without.
Ever since their first irruption from their original
home in central Asia the Turks had menaced the
imperial provinces. They succeeded in wresting vast
lands, and in either driving out their Christian inhabitants
or making them tributary to the cause of Islam.
Asia Minor was lost to the Greek, and the Moslem
negotiated with his foe from the banks of the Bosporus.
During the twelfth century scarcely a year
passed which did not witness some battle between
the Byzantines and the Turks. Defeated by the crusaders,
these quick-moving hordes of the East found
redress in ravaging some part of the empire. When
victorious in Syria they echoed their joy in new
battle-shouts in the direction of the Greek capital.
Their swords dripped blood on the shores of the Marmora
and the Black Sea almost as frequently as on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>the fields of Syria. In 1185 the emperor was compelled
to purchase immunity from attack by paying
tribute to the Sultan of Iconium, and even to call in
the assistance of Saladin to secure him from the aggressions
of other Moslem hordes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Huns also assailed the Byzantine power. In
1184 Maria, dowager empress at Constantinople, was
put to death for having engaged these ruthless people,
under their king, Bela, to invade the empire. Bulgarians,
Patchinaks, Turkomans, Wallachs, and Servians
raided in turn the Balkan peninsula.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crusaders also, with their enormous armies
and the pilgrim hordes that followed them, made
the Greek lines their camping-ground, their forage-fields,
and their battle-sites, until Constantinople
dreaded these fellow-Christians as much as it feared
the Infidels. Richard of England took Cyprus from
the Greeks and ultimately gave it to the Templars.
Henry <abbr title='the sixth'>VI.</abbr> of Germany forced from the emperor five
thousand pounds of gold, as the price of the immunity
of his lands from the ravages of Western armies. The
imperial treasury was so depleted that the churches
of Constantinople were rifled to raise what was thus
called the “German tax.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Beyond the actual aggressions of the Latin Christians
upon their Greek brethren there was developed
a deeper menace in the hatred which had sprung up
between the two peoples. Throughout Europe the
eagerness to exterminate the Moslems was almost
matched by a purpose to subjugate the Greek power.
For this antipathy there were other and special occasions,
some of which we will narrate.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>The Normans, who, under Robert Guiscard, had
in 1062 conquered Sicily, were the inveterate foes of
Constantinople. Robert and his son, Bohemond, invaded
Epirus and Thessaly. In 1107 Bohemond
repeated the attempt to capture the western borders
of the empire. In 1130 Roger of Sicily made alliance
with the German emperor for the same purpose.
William, son of Roger, in 1156 pillaged Corfu, Corinth,
and some of the Ægean Islands, and sent a
fleet to parade his insults in the Bosporus and Golden
Horn, where his sailors shot gilded arrows against
the very palace walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>About 1180 the Emperor Andronicus cruelly
massacred the Latins in Constantinople, dragging
the sick from their beds in the hospital of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John,
and decapitating the papal envoy, Cardinal John,
whose head was tied to a dog’s tail and dragged
about the streets. William <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> of Sicily appointed a
certain Tancred, his agent, to avenge these atrocities.
Tancred sacked Salonica and ravaged Macedonia and
Thrace. In 1194 Henry, King of Sicily, claimed all
these lands and held Irene, daughter of the Emperor
Isaac, as hostage. Thus the Sicilians were always
ready to leap at the throat of the Greek empire in
sheer vengeance, if not with thirst for the blood of
spoil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another menace to the Eastern Empire was from
the Italians, who were represented by large colonies
throughout the imperial territories, and even in the
capital itself, where they enjoyed for a time exceptional
privileges, such as being directly governed by
their own ambassadors, having favored rates of tariff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>on their commerce, often amounting to free trade,
and at times receiving high appointments in the service
of the empire. Yet these prosperous conditions
were frequently interrupted by quarrels with the
Greeks, reaching on occasions to civil war within the
walls of the capital. Pisan and Genoese pirates
ravaged the Ægean, and even blockaded the Dardanelles
against the passage of Greek ships. In 1198
these freebooters defeated the imperial navy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Venice, however, was the most formidable of these
rivals for power within the empire, as she had been
at times the most favored nation. In 1171 the
Venetians attacked Dalmatia and pillaged the Ægean,
until they were forced by herculean efforts of the
Greek government to sue for peace. Henry Dandolo
conducted the mission for treaty, and during his stay
in Constantinople became blind. It is asserted by
the Venetians that his affliction was due to torture
perpetrated upon him by command of the emperor.
It was a common practice of the Greeks to destroy
the sight of those they would render impotent to do
them harm. This ancient punishment was called
abacination; the process was that of forcing the
victim to gaze into a basin of highly polished metal,
which by its shape concentrated the rays of sunlight
and constituted a burning-mirror. Whether this is
the true explanation of his blindness or not, it is certain
that Dandolo ever after displayed an absorbing
passion to wreak vengeance upon the Greek power,
and we shall find him foremost among its foes in the
fatal expedition called the fourth crusade.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, aside from these inducements, the wealth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>the city offered to the covetous a prize second to none
in the world. The situation of Constantinople on the
narrow highway of the Bosporus or Strait of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
George, which connects the Black Sea with the Mediterranean,
made it mistress of the maritime commerce
between Europe and Asia. Neighboring countries
contributed by their very geographical relation to the
power on the Bosporus. The Balkan peninsula, terminating
in the classic land of Greece, and fringed
with the islands of the Ægean and the Adriatic;
the eastern provinces of Europe, drained by the
Danube, whose mouth was hard by; Russia from the
Siberian snows to the temperate climate of the Euxine;
Asia Minor, the seat of ancient civilization in
the middle Orient, even to the entrance of Persia;
the Holy Land, and the fertile valley of the Nile—each
of these, in extent and population enough for
an empire, and all of them lying in easy accessibility,
fitted Constantinople to be the natural capital of the
greatest power in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Its immediate site, too, was inviting. Enthroned
upon magnificent hills, with the harbor of the Golden
Horn as a safe refuge for its fleets, and a salubrious
climate assured by the perpetual breeze from either
of the great seas which lay at its feet, it was the
especial abode of comfort and splendor. In its stately
palaces, churches, and public squares was preserved
the best art inherited from the ancient world, for which
the temples of Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt, and the
isles of the Mediterranean had been rifled. Its merchants
lived with the splendor of princes, dwelling in
palatial homes, adorning themselves with most costly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>robes and rarest gems, and clothing even their horses
with gold. To outrank their subjects in splendor,
princes lived in houses whose columns and walls were
sheathed in golden plates. The palaces of Blachern
and Bucolion were furnished with incredible treasures.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Church of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Sophia, says Benjamin of Tudela
(1161), was richer than “all other places of worship
in the world.” To its magnificence Ephesus had
contributed eight pillars from the temple of Diana;
Aurelian’s Roman temple of the sun, eight columns
of porphyry; the temples of the Nile, twenty-four
columns of polished granite. Its vestries contained
“forty-two thousand robes embroidered with pearls
and precious stones.” But <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Sophia was only one
of many churches whose golden domes flashed over
the Bosporus. Other structures vied with the temples.
The hippodrome was nine hundred feet long, lined
with tiers of white marble seats, from which the spectators,
in the intervals of the races, admired the four
horses in bronze which now surmount the entrance
of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark’s in Venice. Columns, statues, baths
innumerable, feasted the eyes or invited the indulgence
of the citizens.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even more tempting to the covetous piety of the
western Europeans were the stores of sacred relics
possessed by the churches and monasteries. It was
believed that more than half the objects of veneration
associated with dead saints throughout the world
were in case or crypt within Constantinople; and the
common faith attributed to the army of saints thus
honored, and whose ghosts were presumably guarding
their bones, the preservation of the city during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>so many generations. Most of these relics had been
purchased at or stolen from their original resting-places
in different parts of the East; but many undoubtedly
were manufactured to gratify the credulity
of the foreigners who thronged the bazaars.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the treasures of the capital itself must be added
the wealth of the territory subject to it. Western
Europe, as we have seen, had been impoverished by
generations of feudal control; district had warred
upon district until the spoil was insufficient to evoke
further forays. In marked contrast, the Greek lands
had been measurably protected by having a central
government. The ground was well tilled; many
handicrafts were developed. Instead of feudal towers,
shadowing the lower classes with desolation, were
well-filled granaries and storehouses of goods. Fair
roads invited intercourse of adjacent communities;
and at a time when robbers infested the suburbs of
every town, and lay in wait in every forest of Europe,
the shores of the Bosporus and the eastern end of the
Marmora were enlivened with cosey cottages and
pleasant villas. The Westerner cast envious glances
about him whenever he passed the beautiful city
on the strait, and the early crusaders paused to
wonder if it would not pay them as well to extirpate
the Greek heresies as to slaughter the Moslems. This
inquiry was keener from the fact that on every side,
as has been narrated, they saw evidences of weakness.
While amazed at the prosperity, they thought of the
opportunities offered to the sword.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most envious eyes turned upon the Greek
lands were those of the blind old Dandolo. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>remarkable man had become doge of Venice in 1192,
at the age of seventy-two (some say eighty-two), and
was to close his octogenarian period with a series of
exploits which might have been the envy of the most
daring and ambitious youth. To understand the final
diversion of the fourth crusade from its original religious
purpose, we must not lose sight of Dandolo’s
sleepless purpose. This was not recognized at the
time, but is abundantly illustrated by the subsequent
events of the crusade, and confirmed by documents
which have but recently come to light.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>
  <h3 id='chap33' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirty-three'>XXXIII.</abbr> <br> THE SUMMONS TO THE FOURTH CRUSADE—CONTRACT WITH VENICE—EGYPT THE DESTINATION—PHILIP OF SWABIA.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In the year 1198 there came to the papal
throne Innocent <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr>, one of the most
astute, tireless, and ambitious of the pontiffs,
and, to those who accept the righteousness
of the hierarchical supremacy
over the world, one of the best. The failure of recent
enterprises in Palestine afflicted Innocent’s soul.
He announced to the titular Patriarch of Jerusalem
his purpose of massing Europe in another endeavor.
His summons sounded over Christendom: “Arise,
ye faithful; arise, gird on the sword and buckler;
arise and hasten to the help of Jesus Christ. He
Himself will lead your banner to victory.” The
Pope sent his prelates everywhere to bid princes
cease their mutual quarrels and unite in the common
cause. To all who obeyed he gave the usual promise,
in the name of God, of remission of sins. He especially
entreated sinners to mark with the badge of the
cross their moral reformation, and the saintly disposed
to thus add new adornment to their crown of glory.
His own earnestness was illustrated by his melting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the gold and silver dishes in his palace into marketable
metal, and replacing them with vessels of clay
or wood. Foreseeing a lack of money for the holy
emprise, he bade Christian people borrow from the
Jews, who should be compelled to lend without interest.
If such help of the Lord did not procure
any positive blessing to this accursed people, it
would at least prevent the penalty of the total destruction
of their business, which was threatened in
case of their not complying. Even the hated Greeks
were to be allowed some part in this holy warfare.
In his appeals to the Emperor Alexius the Pope
predicts, “The pagans will flee before you;” and
promises, “You yourself will share with the others
in the pontifical favors.” Lest the heretical emperor
should not feel the need of such patronage, Innocent
reminds him that God had said to the Roman pontiff
what He had said of old to Jeremiah: “I have placed
thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root
out, and to pull down, to waste, and to destroy, to
build, and to plant.” He further compares himself
to the sun, and secular princes to the moon, which
shines in borrowed light. The emperor in reply, with
perhaps a premonition of what was about to transpire,
reminded the Pope of the ravages which Western crusaders
were accustomed to inflict upon his realm, and
begged him to first rebuke the crimes which these
zealots for God were disposed to perpetrate against
their fellow-men.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time a French priest, Fulque, was filling
the land with his fame for eloquence. Crowds
thronged to his services in the churches and fields.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>He denounced sin with the power of an Elijah, and
comforted the penitent with the sweetness of a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
John. He adapted himself marvellously to all men,
leading the lordly profligate to repent at the incensed
altar, and making the boorish peasants kiss the stick
with which he beat them to be quiet as they crowded
about him in the fields. Pope Innocent enlarged this
zealot’s commission to be that of another Peter the
Hermit, or Bernard, in preaching the crusade.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among Fulque’s first converts was Count Theobald
of Champagne, to whom over two thousand knights
did homage as his vassals. He was chosen to command
the French contingent. Louis of Chartres and
Blois followed, and soon a host was enrolled representing
the nobility and wealth of France. Among
these was Villehardouin, Marshal of Champagne, to
whom we are largely indebted as the historian of the
events we are about to narrate. Germany also answered
the call. But for the death of Richard of England
(April, 1199), this hero would doubtless have
been chosen to lead the combined host with an English
army. The Venetians do not seem to have
volunteered any help; perhaps it was not anticipated.
The Pope, in his call for the crusade, had expressly
forbidden Venice to furnish the Saracens with iron,
ropes, wood, arms, ships, or munitions of war; for in
the previous holy adventures they had not regarded
trade with the Infidels as infringing upon their Christian
duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The military leaders already chosen were averse to
another overland march to the East, since every interjacent
country was marked with the disasters of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>previous armies; they therefore decided to go by sea.
The commissioners having charge of the expedition
therefore sent messengers to Venice, as the chief maritime
power in the West, to negotiate with Dandolo
for transportation of men and furnishing of provisions.
After a week’s deliberation the Council of Venice
made answer. Dandolo proposed, the people approving,
that the republic should provide the required
vessels and a definite amount of food, and also an independent
fleet, which Dandolo said he would send
“for the love of God.” He, however, required in
payment for such equipment and service eighty-five
thousand silver marks, and that half the cities and
lands conquered should fall to the Venetian possession.
This was eagerly agreed to by the commissioners.</p>

<p class='c007'>A general assembly was convoked in <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark’s in
Venice (April, 1201). Mass was celebrated to secure
Heaven’s blessing upon the compact. Villehardouin
thus addressed the people: “The lords and barons
of France, the most high and the most powerful,
have sent us to you to pray you in the name of
God to take pity on Jerusalem, which the Turks hold
in bondage. They cry to you for mercy and supplicate
you to accompany them to avenge the disgrace
of Jesus Christ. They have made choice of you because
they know that no people that be upon the sea
have such powers as your nation. They have commanded
us to throw ourselves at your feet and not to
rise until you shall have granted our prayer.” The
commissioners fell upon their knees and raised their
hands in supplication to the people. The crowd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>caught the enthusiasm and cried, “We grant your
request.” Dandolo himself overflowed with pious,
not to say politic, emotion. This spectacle of fraternal
union in the cause of Christ drew from all eyes
“tears of tenderness and joy.” The Pope, to whom
the compact was submitted, ratified it with the strict
condition that under no circumstances should an
attack be made upon any Christian state.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was deemed best to land the crusading armies
at Alexandria in Egypt; the voyage thither would be
unmolested. Besides, a series of events had taken
place in Egypt which led many to see the hand of Providence
pointing to that country. In 1200 the Nile
had for some mysterious cause failed to give its annual
inundation; harvests had failed; famine afflicted
the inhabitants, who were reduced to feeding upon
grass, the dung of animals, and even the carcasses of
their fellow-victims. At Cairo women, in the insanity
of starvation, had killed and eaten their own children.
To famine succeeded plague; one hundred and eleven
thousand died of it at Cairo. The unburied lay everywhere;
a fisherman counted four hundred corpses
that floated by him during a single day. The wrappings
of dead bodies were as numerous on the waters
of the Nile as lotus flowers in their season. In the language
of an Arabian, “The most populous provinces
were as a banqueting-hall for the birds of prey.” The
Roman pontiff urged Europe to take the opportunity
of these terrible visitations to break the treaties between
Christians and Moslems and occupy the land
of the Delta. To this advice the military leaders
added the less inhuman consideration that Alexandria
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>would afford a ready entrepôt for supplies from the
West, and a convenient point from which to strike the
enemy; at the same time it would enable the crusaders
to sever the Eastern Infidels from their Saracen
coreligionists along the North African coast. Egypt
was thus chosen as the immediate destination of the
crusade.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after the ratification of the Venetian compact
with the crusaders, Theobald of Champagne, the
chosen commander, died. Boniface of Montferrat
was chosen in his stead. The first movement of
Boniface is suggestive in view of the sequel. He
spent several months at the court of Philip of Swabia,
the rival of Otho for the German throne. Philip had
married the daughter of Isaac Angelus, a deposed
emperor of Constantinople, who had been blinded by
his successor and was now a captive. A son of Isaac,
“young Alexius,” as he was called, to distinguish him
from the reigning monarch of the same name, a lad
of twelve years, was led about by the Emperor Alexius
to grace his triumph. Young Alexius eluded the
vigilance of his keepers and, disguised as a common
sailor, or, as some say, in a box as freight, made his
way to Italy and eventually to the court of his
brother-in-law, Philip of Swabia. Philip was undoubtedly
pledged by his own interests, as well as by
vengeance on behalf of his kinsman, to forward the
project of young Alexius for the restoration of Isaac
to the throne of Constantinople. Boniface, the commander
of the crusaders, was a relative of Philip. He
had also family alliances with the throne of Constantinople.
One of his brothers, Conrad, had married
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Theodora, a sister of Isaac; another, Reynier, had
married Maria, a daughter of the Emperor Manuel.
As the heir of this latter brother, Boniface regarded
himself as <i>de jure</i> King of Salonica. That he was
not averse to the project of Philip and young Alexius
is proved by the fact that on leaving Philip he went
to Rome and endeavored to induce the Pope to declare
himself in favor of young Alexius as a contestant
for the throne of Constantinople against the
reigning monarch. It is well to keep these facts in
mind if one would understand the depth of the plot
which subsequent events exposed.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>
  <h3 id='chap34' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirty-four'>XXXIV.</abbr> <br> THE PLOT FOR THE DIVERSION OF THE CRUSADE—CAPTURE OF ZARA.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The grand departure of the crusaders from
Venice had been fixed for June, 1202.
At that time but a part of the leaders appeared.
Some had taken ship from Bari,
Genoa, and even the ports on the Northern
Ocean, as served their convenience or as they
were able to make better terms than with the Venetians.
Of four thousand expected knights, but one
thousand had arrived; of one hundred thousand men,
less than sixty thousand; of the eighty-five thousand
marks pledged for passage, but thirty-four thousand
were in hand. Dandolo protested against this as
breach of faith with him, and pointed to his fleet, waiting,
manned and provisioned, in the harbor. He demanded
the immediate payment of the entire sum.
In vain had the crusaders sent what they could to
the ducal palace—money, vessels of silver and gold,
jewels, and securities on their lands. The doge
declared, according to Robert de Clari, who was in
this army, “If you do not pay, understand well that
you will not move from this spot, nor will you find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>any one who will furnish you with meat and drink.”
The crusading army thus found itself a crowd of
starving prisoners on a fever-fraught island near
Venice. In the heat of the summer many sickened
and died; others managed to escape. Those who remained
communicated with friends in France and induced
a few more knights and nobles to join them.
But with this assistance, and though the richest of
them had stripped themselves of possessions until
nothing but horses and armor were left, the debt was
unpaid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having gotten from them all that was possible,
Dandolo assumed the rôle of friendship and proposed
to forgive the remainder of their obligation upon condition
of first receiving their help as soldiers in an expedition
against Zara, which he had in contemplation.
The city of Zara was Christian, the capital of Dalmatia,
a province of Hungary, and just across the
Adriatic from Venice. It was rapidly rising into the
position of a competitor for the commerce of those
waters, and thus excited the greed of the doge.</p>

<p class='c007'>But a richer prize than Zara was before the ambition
of the Venetian ruler. From the beginning of
his negotiations with the crusaders he doubtless contemplated
the diversion of these forces, though collected
in the name of religion, to the conquest of the
Greek empire. Documents that have recently come
to light make it clear that Dandolo had no purpose
of assisting in war against Egypt and Palestine, but,
in collusion with Boniface and Philip of Swabia,
planned and executed one of the most marvellous
schemes of perfidy that history portrays.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>As the basis of this severe judgment we must be
content to give the dates of certain events.</p>

<p class='c007'>February 1, 1201, commissioners of the crusaders
arrive in Venice, asking Dandolo’s assistance with the
fleet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Autumn, 1201, Dandolo sends agents to Malek-Ahdel,
of Egypt, proposing a settled peace with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>May 13, 1202, Dandolo concludes secret treaty
with Malek-Ahdel, in accordance with which the
Venetians are to have favored quarters in Alexandria
for trade, and all pilgrims to Jerusalem who come
under Venetian patronage are to be forwarded with
safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>June 24, 1202, crusaders arrive in Venice, and
Dandolo refuses to provide them ships.</p>

<p class='c007'>July, 1202, treaty between Dandolo and Malek-Ahdel
formally ratified.</p>

<p class='c007'>With these layers of the foundation we may understand
the superstructure of after events. The proposal
to attack Zara thus appears as the first movement in
realizing the plot to divert the Christian forces from
Egypt. Vainly did the noblest of the crusaders protest
against this sacrilegious use of arms which had
been consecrated only to the service of the cross. In
vain did Pope Innocent denounce it with his divine
authority. Dandolo relentlessly pursued his advantage,
and with such consummate tact that the cardinal
legate of the Pope, Peter Capuano, expressed himself
convinced that it would be less of a sin to take part
in the capture of Zara, and then pursue the original
object of the crusade, than to return home having
done nothing. Dandolo completed the delusion he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>was practising upon the people by allowing himself
to be led up the pulpit of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark’s (August 25th),
where he thus addressed the Venetians: “I am old
and infirm; as you see, I have need of rest; yet I
know of no one more capable of taking command of
your undertaking than myself. If you desire it, I
will myself take the cross and go with you and the
pilgrims for life and death.” The assembly cried,
“Come with us for God’s sake!” Dandolo was then
led to the altar, and, while his agents were signing the
compact with the Infidel, knelt amid the tears and
huzzas of his people to have the cross fastened upon
his ducal bonnet. The papal legate indeed protested
against any one posing as the head of the armies
summoned by the Pope who did not acknowledge
the pontiff’s leadership through his representative, but
Dandolo read him a lesson on the duty of ecclesiastics
to content themselves with preaching the gospel and
setting a godly example to the flock.</p>

<p class='c007'>Villehardouin narrates at this point “a great wonder,
an unhoped-for circumstance, the strangest that
ever was heard of.” This event was the arrival in
Venice of the ambassadors of young Alexius, asking
in the name of justice and humanity the aid of the
Venetians in the liberation of his father and the
restoration of his own princely rights at Constantinople.
It is evident that Villehardouin’s surprise
was not shared by either Dandolo or Boniface of
Montferrat.</p>

<p class='c007'>October 8th the fleet sailed from the lagoons. It
consisted of four hundred and eighty ships. It was
a gala-day: palaces and storehouses were covered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>with brilliant banners and streamers; the guilds
rivalled one another in the gorgeousness of their
flags, floats, and various insignia. The ships were
arrayed in responsive glory as one by one they glided
out to sea. About the bulwarks of each vessel were
hung the polished shields of the knights it carried.
The doge’s galley was vermilion-hued, the color of
royalty. The sound of silver trumpets echoed the
lapping of the waves as the fleet moved out upon the
Adriatic, while the ancient hymn, “Veni, Creator
Spiritus,” was chanted by priests and monks from the
crosstrees of the ships.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pausing at Trieste, the fleet on November 11th
entered and captured the harbor of Zara. The citizens
at first proposed to surrender if their lives should
be spared; but later, learning of the Pope’s mandate
forbidding the crusaders to attack their fellow-Christians,
and assuming that it would suffice for their
protection, they withdrew the offer. Dandolo ordered
an assault. Many of the crusaders refused to obey
his order. At a council in the tent of the doge, the
Abbot of Vaux exclaimed, “I forbid you, in the name
of the Pope, to attack this city. It is a city of Christian
men, and you are soldiers of the cross.” This
bold speech nearly cost him his life. Dandolo braved
the threat of excommunication and assailed the walls.
In five days (November 24, 1202) Zara fell. The
people were pillaged, many were banished, some beheaded,
and others mercifully allowed to flee, leaving
their houses and goods to the captors. Dandolo proposed
to divide the city as common spoil and to enjoy
its comforts for the winter. His purpose was too evident;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>it was to take time to effectually establish the
Venetian control on the eastern shore of the Adriatic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crusaders were made aware that they had been
used as cat’s-paws for the doge’s chestnuts. To disappointment
succeeded remorse. They began to
meditate upon the papal excommunication they had
so foolishly provoked. The Venetians, meanwhile,
managed to get the larger part of the spoil, and the
soldiers were often suffering while their allies were
feasting. This led to continual fighting in the streets,
where more fell than had been slain during the siege.
The more valiant longed for service against the Infidel,
not against Christians; the commoner souls
longed for home. Desertions took place in bands of
hundreds and even thousands. The French leaders
humbly petitioned the Pope’s forgiveness. It was
granted on condition of their setting out for Syria,
“without turning to the right or left.” The Holy
Father pledged them his care if they immediately
obeyed, and promised, “In order that you may not
want for provisions, we will write to the Emperor of
Constantinople to furnish them; if that be refused it
will not be unjust if, after the example of many holy
persons, you take provisions wherever you may find
them.” This permission to pillage the Pope extenuates
by adding, “Provided it be with the fear of God,
without doing harm to any person, and with a resolution
to make restitution.” At the same time he
argues for the righteousness of taking other’s goods
without their permission: “For it will be known
that you are devoted to the cause of Christ, to whom
all the world belongs.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>This papal intervention jeopardized the schemes
of the Venetians; but, very opportunely for those
opposed to the Pope’s counsel, there arrived at Zara
ambassadors from Philip of Swabia, the brother-in-law
of young Alexius. In their address they said:
“We do not come for the purpose of turning you
aside from your holy enterprise, but to offer you an
easy and sure means of accomplishing your noble
designs.... We propose to you to turn your victorious
arms towards the capital of Greece, which
groans under the rod of a usurper, and to assure
yourselves forever of the conquest of Jerusalem by
that of Constantinople.... We will not tell you
how easy a matter it would be to wrest the empire
from the hands of a tyrant hated by his subjects;
nor will we spread before your eyes the riches of
Byzantium and Greece.... If you overturn the
power of the usurper in order that the legitimate
sovereign may reign, the son of Isaac [young Alexius]
promises, under the faith of oaths the most inviolable,
to maintain during a year both your fleet and your
army, and to pay you two hundred thousand silver
marks towards the expenses of the holy war. He
will accompany you in person in the conquest of Syria
or Egypt, and will furnish ten thousand men, and
maintain during his whole life five hundred knights
in the Holy Land.” Then followed a clause which
was supposed to catch the consciences of the most
pious: “Alexius is willing to swear on the holy
Gospels that he will put an end to the heresy which
now defiles the Empire of the East, and will subject
the Greek Church to the Church of Rome.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>The proposal did not carry to all conviction of its
wisdom and justice. The Franks had reason to suspect
the good faith of the Greeks. Blind Isaac,
whom they were called upon to restore to his throne,
had been himself a usurper, as unjust to his predecessor
as his successor had been to him, and, moreover,
had done everything in his power to defeat the
previous crusades. But the Venetian influence prevailed.</p>

  <h3 id='chap35' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirty-five'>XXXV.</abbr> <br> ON TO CONSTANTINOPLE—CAPTURE OF GALATA.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The Venetians and crusaders left Zara in
ruins, its palaces and walls razed to the
ground. They sailed for Corfu. Dandolo
and Boniface waited five days until
they were joined by young Alexius.
These chiefs paused at Durazzo, where the inhabitants
were led to recognize Alexius as the lawful
heir to the sovereignty, and on May 4, 1203, they
joined the army before Corfu.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here there was developed great dissatisfaction
among the soldiers as the full meaning of the diversion
of the crusade burst upon them. More than
half the army rose in rebellion; they held their parliament
of protest; the leaders were gathered in a
secluded valley preparatory to desertion. It seemed
for the moment that conscience and piety, fanned
by resentment, would triumph over chicanery and
deceit; but Dandolo and Boniface were equal to the
situation. They threw themselves at the feet of the
malcontents, shed abundance of tears, and so wrought
upon the sympathies of the multitude that they
effected a compromise, by which it was agreed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>the army should hold together until Michaelmas and
serve Alexius’s project, and after that should be
carried to Syria.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dandolo realized that there was no security for his
schemes with such a host, except by their quick accomplishment.
May <abbr title='twenty-third'>23d</abbr> the harbor of Corfu witnessed
a repetition of the gala-scene when the fleet
left Venice. Far as the eye could reach the sea was
colored with the sails of the invaders of a Christian
empire in the name of Christ. The inhabitants of
the islands touched by the voyagers, impressed with
the martial might thus displayed, threw off their
allegiance to the reigning Alexius and waved their
banners for Alexius the Young. The natural beauties
of the Ægean, the riches of the islands, the acquiescence
of the people, and the abundant gifts
from fields and vineyards that loaded the vessels
filled all hearts with enthusiasm. By the shores of
ancient Troy, up through the Dardanelles, where
they lingered a week to ravage the harvest, and
then over the wide Marmora they sped onward as
if the very breezes articulated benedictions from
Heaven. If conscience intruded, its mutterings were
silenced with the thought, “After this, after Constantinople,
when we shall have been sated with the
spoil of the heretic, then for Jerusalem!” This
mingled greed and piety burst into huzzas as they
sailed by the beautiful villas which lined the western
shores of the Marmora or watched the steadily enlarging
roofs and gardens of Chalcedon and Scutari on the
Asiatic side, until the domes and palaces of Constantinople,
in multitude and massiveness beyond anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>seen elsewhere in Europe, seemed to rise and
welcome them.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the mighty walls, which appeared to have
been erected by Titans and rivalled the hills upon
which the city sat, awakened a corresponding fear
lest the glory they witnessed should prove beyond
their possession. “Be sure,” says Villehardouin,
“there was not a man who did not tremble, because
never was so great an enterprise undertaken by so
small a number of men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>June <abbr title='twenty-third'>23d</abbr> the fleet came to anchor off the Abbey
of San Stefano, twelve miles below the city. Dandolo
determined upon a reconnaissance in force which
should also strike terror into the Greeks by its magnificent
display. All the standards were spread to
the breeze. The sides of the ships were sheathed in
glowing shields. The warriors of the West stood on
the deck, each one, says Nicetas, the Greek eye-witness,
“as tall as his spear.” Thus they glided close
under the walls of the city, upon which the inhabitants
crowded to witness this picturesque prediction
of their doom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having made a sufficiently valiant show, the fleet
crossed the Bosporus and anchored in the harbor of
Chalcedon. Here the army captured the harvests
just gathered from the neighboring country, and pillaged
Chalcedon, while the leaders occupied the palaces
and gardens, upon which the emperor had just
expended great wealth in making them the abode of
his pleasure. The reigning Alexius deigned to send
to his unwelcome guests a body of troopers, who
were driven off with severe chastisement for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>temerity. He then addressed them through Nicholas
Roux, a Lombard retainer: “The emperor knows
that you are the most puissant and noble of all those
who do not wear the crown; but he is astonished at
your invasion of a Christian state. It is said that
you have come to deliver the Holy Land from the
Infidel. The emperor applauds your zeal and begs
to assist you. If you are needy he will provision
your army if you will be gone. Do not think this
generous offer prompted by any fear; with one word
the emperor could gather about him innumerable
hosts, disperse your fleet and armies, and forever
close against you the routes to the East.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Conan de Bethune made response for the Latins:
“Go tell your master that the earth we tread upon
does not belong to him, but is the heritage of the
prince you see seated among us,” pointing to young
Alexius. “A usurper is the enemy of all princes; a
tyrant is the foe of mankind. Your master can escape
the justice of God and men only by restoring
his brother and nephew to the throne.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dandolo then tried the spirit of the people of
Constantinople. A splendid galley bearing young
Alexius moved close along the walls of the city.
Boniface and the doge supported the prince on their
arms, while a herald proclaimed, “Behold the heir
of your throne!” This met with no response save
the derisive shout, “Who is this Alexius?” But
the defiance hurled by the Greeks from the safety of
their walls was not the voice of universal courage.
Nicetas tells us that “the Greek commanders were
more timid than deer, and did not dare to resist men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>whom they called ‘exterminating angels, statues of
bronze, which spread around terror and death.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day at Scutari the leaders, according to
their custom, held council of war in the saddle in the
presence of their waiting troops. An instant assault
was determined upon. After due religious solemnities
they embarked. The war-horses, heavily caparisoned
for battle, with their knights in armor at their
sides, were put upon <i>huissiers</i>, or flat-bottomed boats
constructed with wide gangways across which a number
could quickly dash from ship to shore. The rank
and file were packed into larger vessels. The fighting
galleys were trimmed for action, and each took
in tow a huissier. Much depended upon the celerity
of the crossing and the surprise of the Greeks, since
the swift current of the Bosporus might quickly ingulf
them in the terrible Greek fire if the combustible
material should be spread upon the water. At sound
of trumpet the Venetian rowers sprang to the oars;
the narrow Bosporus suddenly foamed with the impact
of hundreds of prows. No order was observed,
except that the crossbowmen and archers led the van
to drive the enemy from the landing-places. The
ships struck the shore probably near the modern
Tophana, north of the Golden Horn. The Greek
soldiers could not withstand the showers of arrows
that swept the open places, and precipitately fled.
The knights leaped their horses into the water and
prevented the enemy’s return to attack. Within an
hour the open camp of the Greeks was in possession
of the Latins. The harbor of the Golden Horn had
been closed with a chain, behind which the Greek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>fleet lay in apparent immunity from attack by the
Venetian galleys. The northern end of this chain
was fastened within the strong tower of Galata.
That fortress was quickly carried and the chain released,
but not until the Venetian ship, the <i>Eagle</i>,
with its tremendous ram armed with enormous shears
of steel, had already severed it midway. The Latin
galleys swept in, sinking or capturing the entire
Greek fleet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marine defence of Constantinople, which might
with ordinary foresight have been made resistless,
was inconsiderable. The demoralization of the Greek
service was pitiable. Admirals had sold the very
sails for their own private gain. Useless masts had
not been replaced, though the near forests abounded
in timber; for the trees, as Nicetas tells us, were
guarded by the eunuchs like groves of worship, but
really as hunting-preserves for the pleasure of the
court.</p>

<p class='c007'>The victory of the Latin fleet left Galata their easy
prey, and gave them a near basis from which to conduct
operations against the city across the Golden
Horn.</p>

  <h3 id='chap36' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirty-six'>XXXVI.</abbr> <br> CONSTANTINOPLE SECURED TO ISAAC AND YOUNG ALEXIUS—USURPATION OF MOURTZOUPHLOS.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Four days were spent in bringing over
from the Asiatic side the provisions.
Dandolo proposed to transport all the
soldiers with his fleet and assault the
water wall of the city, where, presuming
upon the defence of their ships, the Greeks had left
the fortifications weakest. But the crusaders, accustomed
only to land operations, were averse to this
plan and marched around the end of the Golden Horn.
The fleet met them opposite the palace of Blachern,
which occupied the corner of the northwestern wall
and thus faced both land and sea. Though the walls
extended for seven miles, this spot was regarded as
the strongest of all. A wide moat was backed by
three enormous lines of masonry, to capture one of
which was only to lodge beneath the terrible menace
of the others. Immense towers were so close together
that to pass between them would be to challenge
burial beneath the missiles which could readily
be dropped from almost above their heads. Here
twice within the preceding half-century the Greeks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>had discomfited the Arab hosts. At this point the
Turks, under Mohammed <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, were, two hundred and
fifty years later, to make their victorious assault. The
Greeks within the city were assisted by armies without,
which, under Theodore Lascaris, the hero of the
day on the part of the besieged, assailed the camps
of the crusaders.</p>

<p class='c007'>July 17th witnessed the grand assault. Boniface
and Baldwin were in command. The battering-rams
delivered their blows until one tower fell. Platform-ladders
were quickly reared; fifteen Flemings secured
a footing on the outer wall, but were slain or
captured by men of their own blood, the hired Waring
guard. The Venetians’ attack was more successful;
their ships were covered with rawhides to
protect them from the Greek fire, which flashed like
liquid lightning from the walls above and spread in
sheets of flame over the water. Bridges had been
arranged from the crosstrees, which, as the vessels
were anchored close to the shore, reached to the top
of the walls. Every huissier carried a mangonel,
which returned the stones hurled by the besieged.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle being contested thus far with equal
skill, Dandolo gave orders to land; he himself set the
example. Old and blind, he was carried in the arms
of his attendants, and, with the banner of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark floating
above him, placed upon the shore. His
heroism inspired his men. While the fight raged
above their heads, on the bridges that ran from the
rigging to the walls, the host below erected their
scaling-ladders and emerged upon the parapets.
Soon the gonfalon of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark floated from a captured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>tower. Twenty-five more of these strongholds
were quickly taken. The Venetians poured down
through the streets of the city. Setting fire to the
buildings, their progress was led by a vanguard of
flame.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this terrible emergency the emperor was caught
by a momentary impulse of valor, and, putting himself
at the head of sixty battalions, sallied from the
city to strike the crusaders. The multitude of his
men, their splendid accoutrements, and their unanticipated
appearance led the crusaders to leave their
assault upon the ramparts and range for defence behind
their palisades. A more serious consequence
of this valiant counter-attack was that it forced Dandolo
to leave what he had already conquered and
hasten to the assistance of his allies. But the Greeks
had exhausted their fury in its first outburst, and
made no further onset, contenting themselves with
showering arrows from safe distance. Theodore
Lascaris, the son-in-law of the emperor, in vain asked
the imperial permission to assail the crusaders’ intrenchments.
Alexius <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> was content with the
martial glory of having paraded before his foe; his
troops, carrying the eagles of ancient Rome, as if the
more to emphasize their shame, retreated without
having struck a blow with the naked sword.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning (July 18, 1203) the city was
filled with a deeper sense of disgrace as the people
learned that the emperor himself had stolen away
during the night, taking with him a bag of gold and
jewels, leaving his empire to him who could hold it,
and his wife amid the spoil. Alexius <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> was a despicable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>character, as cowardly as he was cruel, crafty,
but without will power to sustain his own designs
when they exacted much energy. His natural
weaknesses had been increased by the habits of a
voluptuary and drunkard until he had become but a
crowned imbecile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Realizing the condition of affairs, the troops, led
by Constantine, the minister of finance, raised the
cry for the deposed Isaac. The courtiers ran to his
prison in the vaults of the Blachern, broke off his
chains, and led the old and blinded man out, as he,
having become hopeless of relief, believed, to execution,
but, to his grateful surprise, to be seated again
upon his throne. The wife of Isaac was sought out
in an obscure quarter of the city, where she was living,
grateful for even life; while the wife of the fugitive
Alexius <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> was thrust into a dungeon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The recall of their former emperor could scarcely
have been prompted by affection or even respect for
him personally. Isaac was without character. Buffoons
despised him for allowing himself to be the
chief court fool. His ambition was divided between
his sensuality and his extravagance; he had twenty
thousand eunuchs, and spent four million pounds
sterling on the housekeeping of his palace. His piety
seems to have been limited to a belief in the prediction
of a flattering patriarch, who had once assured
him of an indefinite conquest of the world, for which,
however, he made no preparation other than invoking
an alliance with Saladin, whose sword he would
buy to hew down his Christian opponents.</p>

<p class='c007'>The news of the change of emperors was not assuring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>to the leaders of the Latins. Notwithstanding
the pretence of having come to right the wrongs
of Isaac, their plans necessitated either their own
occupancy of the empire or the placing of young
Alexius as the creature of their will upon the throne.
Alexius, not Isaac, had made the bargain to pay the
Westerners for their expedition two hundred thousand
marks of silver, to furnish the army and fleet
with provision for a year, and to bring the Greek
Church into subjection to Rome. Would Isaac assume
the same obligations?</p>

<p class='c007'>The Latins sent a deputation to the palace; they
passed between the lines of the same hired soldiers
that yesterday guarded Alexius <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr>, equally loyal
to whatever hand fed them. There, upon a throne
of superlative splendor, the Latin deputies saw the
resurrected relic of a former monarch, blind and
emaciated. To have rendered the picture sensationally
complete, old and blind Dandolo should have
stood before Isaac.</p>

<p class='c007'>Villehardouin, who was one of the deputies, demanded
of Isaac the confirmation of the contract
made by young Alexius. On learning its nature,
Isaac expressed his amazement and the impossibility
of meeting it. The deputies assured the old man
that his son should never be permitted to enter the
city unless his father assumed his pledges. The
emperor replied, “Surely the bargain is a hard one,
and I cannot see how to carry it out; but you have
done so much for him and me that you deserve our
whole empire.” With hand trembling with age and
fright he set to the compact the golden seal.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>The deputies returned to the camp. Young Alexius
entered the city, riding, with a retinue of knights,
between Dandolo and Baldwin of Flanders, and
followed by the Latin clergy; they were met at the
gates by the various ranks of Greek ecclesiastics, arrayed
in splendid vestments. The churches throughout
the city resounded with thanksgiving and the
streets with festivity, while within the palace Isaac,
having endured a dungeon for eight years, embraced
his son whom he could not see.</p>

<p class='c007'>August 1st Alexius was crowned coemperor in <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Sophia; he immediately cancelled a portion of his
indebtedness to his allies, and wrote to the Pope,
avowing his purpose to recognize Rome as the ecclesiastical
head of the Greek empire. The Pope,
knowing the vicissitude of affairs and distrusting the
volatile disposition of the youth, replied, urging him
to speedily practicalize his good intention. At the
same time the Holy Father addressed the crusaders,
declaring that, “unless the emperor made haste to do
what he had promised, it would appear that neither
his protestations nor their intentions were sincere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The payment Alexius was able to make to those
who had sold themselves to his service was not sufficient
to satisfy their ambitious greed; it barely sufficed
to pay back to each soldier the money he had
been compelled to cash down to the Venetians for his
passage, and which had left the Latin army bankrupt
in a foreign land. But the Greek treasury was empty
and could not meet the expenses of the new government,
nor even provide for the personal protection of
the emperors against their domestic foes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>If the adherents of the fugitive Alexius <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> were
not to be feared, there were new aspirants to the
throne, which had come to be recognized as the legitimate
spoil of usurpers; besides, the emperor’s pledge
to recognize the Pope’s supremacy had kindled fury
in the breasts of the Greek devotees. The monk was
accustomed in those days to finger his dagger as well
as his beads. The Waring guard could alone be
trusted, but their loyalty would lapse at the first passing
of a pay-day. Some men are stimulated by necessity—hardship
evokes their genius; but the Latins
knew that Alexius was not of this sort. Scarcely out
of boyhood, he was already displaying the vices and
weaknesses for which his race was notorious. He
needed a guardian—a Dandolo or Boniface, or both.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was therefore evident that if the new régime
were not to be an immediate failure, carrying down
with it the honor of the Latins, the latter must continue
at Constantinople in spite of the fact that the
agreement between the Venetians and the army expired
at Michaelmas. They were forced to accept
Alexius’s proposition that they should remain with
him for another year. Thus circumstances conspired
to favor Dandolo in his compact with Malek-Ahdel
and to check the impatience of the crusaders for a
march upon Syria or Egypt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reign of Alexius and Isaac was inaugurated
by a terrible calamity. According to long custom,
the Arab and other Moslem traders had been allowed
to occupy a section of the city with their bazaars and
mosque. The crusading zeal, baffled of finding its
natural vent in Palestine, sought a slight compensation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>in looting this smaller nest of Infidels. During
the fighting that ensued fire was started in several
places. Under a strong north wind it swept in a
wide swath across the city; then, the breeze shifting,
the conflagration raged in another direction. For
eight days there was a continual crash of falling
houses, palaces, and churches, thousands of the homeless
population fleeing through smoke and cinders
from the pursuing flames. Many perished, and at the
cessation of the ravages multitudes were left in utter
destitution. The blackened ruins covered a section
half a league in width and two leagues in length, extending
from the Golden Horn to the Marmora.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fury of the elements was followed by as destructive
a fury of human passions. The Greek rose
to exterminate the Latin resident population. All
were driven out. Fifteen thousand of these sojourners
escaped across the harbor to Galata, that
their lives might be saved in the camp of the crusaders.</p>

<p class='c007'>This disaster rendered hopeless any further payment
of the debt pledged by Alexius. The crusaders
took advantage of the situation to inaugurate
a plan to capture the city for themselves, to depose
both emperors, and seat upon the throne one of their
own number. It was first necessary to provoke a
formal breach with Alexius and Isaac. A deputation
was therefore sent them to demand instant payment
or war. The Greek populace resented this
insult to their rulers, whose office they worshipped
even if they had contempt for their pusillanimity.
They retaliated upon the Westerners by attempting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>to burn the Venetian fleet with fire-boats floated
among the ships, and trying to destroy the crusaders’
camp by a sudden cavalry attack.</p>

<p class='c007'>A more serious menace was in the popular meetings
held daily in <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Sophia to denounce the emperors
and to demand their displacement to make
way for some stronger hand. The leader of this
movement was Alexius Ducas, called Mourtzouphlos
because of his meeting eyebrows. The populace,
with whom this man was unsavory, offered the crown
to Nicholas Kanabos. Alexius was kept a virtual
prisoner in the Blachern, defended by his Warings.
Mourtzouphlos came to the palace, and, persuading
Alexius that a mob was about to attack him, pretended
to conduct him to a place of safety. Getting
him thus to his own tent, Mourtzouphlos put the
young man in irons, shod himself with the vermilion
buskins, and strode out, proclaiming that he was
emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>With vast energy the usurper set about refortifying
the city. He impressed Dandolo and Boniface
with the fact that they had now to deal with a man
not unlike themselves in ability and daring. What
they were to do must be done quickly. They made
to Mourtzouphlos the proposition, “Give us Alexius,
and we will depart and allow you to remain emperor.”
With this prince in their hands they could still scheme.
The reply came, “Alexius is dead.” He had been
found lifeless in his chamber (February 1, 1204).
Isaac soon followed his son with as mysterious a
taking off. Dandolo then proposed a personal interview
with the new monarch. The meeting was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>held a half-mile beyond the palace. Treacherously
a squad of Latin horsemen raided the place of conference,
capturing some of the imperial body-guard,
but Mourtzouphlos escaped.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing now remained for the Latins but to risk
all in an assault upon the city.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>
  <h3 id='chap37' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirty-seven'>XXXVII.</abbr> <br> CAPTURE OF CONSTANTINOPLE.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>By April 8th all preparations were completed.
It was determined to boldly
cross the Golden Horn from Galata and
assail the water front of the city. At a
hundred points at once they flung the
bridges from the yard-arms to the top of the wall,
while at the same time they battered the base with
rams. The air about them was a firmament of flame
from the heavy discharges of Greek fire, through
which hurtled stones, javelins, and arrows in such
storm that flesh could not stand against it. At night
the Latins retired, confessing the failure of the first
attempt. The churches of the city resounded with
grateful prayers, and the streets were riotous with
joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 12th the assault was renewed. The ships
now fought in pairs, so that a heavier force of men
might land upon the walls from each drawbridge.
Two transports, the <i>Pilgrim</i> and the <i>Paradise</i>, having
on board the bishops of Troyes and Soissons,
carried one of the towers and planted there the banners
of these ecclesiastics. Soon four towers more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>succumbed; the gates beneath them were forced open,
and the knights, who had waited by their horses on
the transports, dashed into the city. The Venetians
say that their blind old hero was among the first to
pass the gates, and that there was fulfilled the
prophecy of an ancient sibyl: “A gathering together
of the powerful shall be made amid the waves of the
Adriatic under a blind leader; they shall beset the
goat [the symbol of Greek power in Daniel’s vision], ... they
shall profane Byzantium, ... they
shall blacken her buildings; ... her spoils shall be
dispersed.” The Latins charged straight for Mourtzouphlos’s
headquarters; his body-guard fought well,
but were no match for the heavy-armored knights,
and soon fled. Such was the consternation of the
Greeks that even the size of the Latins was fabulously
exaggerated, Nicetas crediting one gigantic
soldier with eighteen yards to his stature, and a proportionate
strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>At night the crusaders, having set fire to the
houses on every side of them, occupied the deserted
camps of the emperor, which he had set up in the
district burned by the previous conflagration. The
next day they encountered no opposition, as Mourtzouphlos
had fled away through the Golden Gate on
the Marmora side of the city. With the exception
of the imperial treasury and arsenal, all was given up
to be plundered by sailors and soldiers. Before the
assault the barons had divided among themselves the
palaces. Villehardouin boastfully narrates: “Never
since the world was created was there so much booty
gained in one city; each man took the house which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>pleased him, and there was enough for all. Those
who were poor found themselves suddenly rich.
There was captured an immense supply of gold and
silver, of plate and precious stones, of satins and silks,
of furs, and of every kind of wealth found upon
earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greek eye-witnesses give the same picture,
but in other colors. They tell how neither matron
nor nun, age nor condition, home nor church, was
safe from brigandage; nor yet the tombs of the dead,
since the coffins of the ancient emperors were opened,
that the gems might be taken from their wrappings
and golden rings from their finger-bones. The body
of Justinian was thus rudely exposed after its sleep
of centuries. The sacred chalices of the communion-table
were distributed to the crowd for drinking-cups.
The vessels of the altar were thrown into heaps, together
with the table plate of the rich, to be parcelled
out among the victors. Holy vestments were used
as saddle-cloths. Mules were driven into <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Sophia
and there on the mosaic floors were loaded with the
furniture which piety had adored and art had cherished
for ages. The altars were broken into pieces,
that the bits of precious metal in them might be extracted,
and the veil of the sanctuary was torn into
shreds for the sake of its golden fringe. A slattern
courtesan was enthroned in the chair of the patriarch
and entertained the rabble with obscene dances
and songs, while men who had left their homes for
the service of Christ played at dice upon the tables
which represented His apostles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nicetas, the historian, describes his own escape.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>A Venetian, whom he had served a good turn, defended
his house as long as he could. When this
was no longer possible he led away the unfortunate
family and a few friends, roughly treating them as if
they were his prisoners. The young ladies of Nicetas’s
household blackened their faces to mar their
fairness. The beauty of one shone through this disguise;
she was seized by some passing soldiers and
liberated only at the tearful solicitation of her father.
Looking back upon the city, of which he had been
a chief ornament and whose epitaph he was to write,
Nicetas exclaimed, “Queen of cities, who art become
the sport of strangers, the companions of the wild
beasts that inhabit the forests, we shall never revisit
thy august domes, and can only fly with terror around
thee, like sparrows around the spot where their nest
has been destroyed.” On the road he came up with
the Patriarch of Constantinople, without bag or
money, stick or shoes, and with but “one coat, like
a true apostle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The plunder of the city was evenly divided between
the crusaders and the Venetians. The hard cash
discovered in treasure vaults or concealed in wells
amounted in value to over eight millions of dollars.
The value of movable wealth of various kinds has
been estimated at one hundred millions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greed thus fed, but not satiated, seemed to
turn the brains of the conquerors and to transform
them into veritable barbarians, as the Greeks denominated
them. Works of art were ruthlessly
destroyed, bronze statues were melted for the sake
of their metal, and rarest marbles broken in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>abandon of resuscitated savagery. Thus perished
the colossal figure of Juno from Samos, so large that
it required four oxen to carry away its head; the
statue of Paris presenting the apple of discord to
Venus; the famous obelisk surmounted by a female
figure that turned with the wind, and covered with
exquisite bas-reliefs; the equestrian statue of Pegasus;
the “Hercules” of Lysippus, whose thumb was
the size of a living man’s waist; the bronze ass which
Augustus Cæsar had ordered to commemorate the
victory of Antium; the ancient group of the wolf
suckling Romulus and Remus; and the statue of
Helen of Troy. Out of the ruin of such inestimable
treasures of art the four horses which now adorn the
porticos of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark’s in Venice were saved from the
general wreck, to stand as a monument among the
Venetians not of the glory, but of the vandalism of
their ancestors.</p>

<p class='c007'>But more than the spoils of art and treasure, the
sacred relics stored in Constantinople excited the
saintly cupidity of the conquerors. In their greed
for these objects men utterly forgot the divine law,
and silenced the last remonstrance of human conscience.
Martin Litz, Abbot of Basel, worming his
way through the pillage piles in a church, came upon
an old Greek monk at prayer. “Your relics or your
life!” was the alternative offered him. Martin thus
procured the key to an iron safe and rifled it of bones
and jewels, without thought that the eighth commandment
held good as between a Romanist and
heretics. Gunther, a German monk, telling the story
of what he witnessed at this time, rejoices that thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>was secured a piece of the True Cross, the skeleton
of John the Baptist, and an arm of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> James. As
the transportation of these articles to the West was
accomplished without their having been again stolen
by some shrewder saint or sunk to the bottom of the
sea, Gunther believed that they had been watched
over by angels especially sent from heaven to convoy
the treasure. It would seem that some ghostly intervention
must have restrained John the Baptist and
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> James from visiting their wrath upon these unconscionable
robbers of their bones. The abbey of
Cluny received thus the head of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Clement; the
cathedral of Amiens the head of John the Baptist;
and the various churches of Europe such articles as
Jacob’s pillow at Bethel, the rod of Moses, the wood
of the True Cross, the drops of blood shed in Gethsemane,
the sponge and reed of Calvary, the first
tooth and locks of the infant Jesus, a piece of the
bread of the Last Supper, a tear of our Lord, a thorn
from His crown, the finger which Thomas thrust into
His side, the shirt and girdle of the Virgin Mary.
But these did not satisfy the relic-hunters. Churches
in Europe competed with one another for the objects
of adoration, which brought revenue to their coffers;
prices went up, but Byzantine craft was able to make
the supply equal the demand. A few years later
(1215) the Lateran Council had, in the name of common
sense, to caution the faithful against becoming
the prey of their own credulity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even the enormous aggrandizement of the Latins,
and the advantages to be derived, in the estimate of
Western piety, from the union of the Greek and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>Roman churches, could not subdue the general sense
of shame at the atrocities which had been perpetrated.
Pope Innocent <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> wrote: “Since, in your obedience
to the Crucified One, you took upon yourself the
vow to deliver the Holy Land from the power of the
pagans, and since you were forbidden, under pain of
excommunication, to attack any Christian land or to
damage it, unless its inhabitants opposed your passage
or refused you what was necessary, and since
you had neither right nor pretence of right over
Greece, you have slighted your vow; you have preferred
earthly to heavenly riches; but that which
weighs more heavily upon you than all this is that
you have spared nothing that is sacred, neither age
nor sex. You have given yourselves up to debauchery
in the face of all the world, you have glutted
your guilty passions, and you have pillaged in such
fashion that the Greek Church, although borne down
by persecution, refuses obedience to the apostolical
see, because it sees in the Latins only treason and
the works of darkness, and loathes them like dogs.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>
  <h3 id='chap38' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirty-eight'>XXXVIII.</abbr> <br> FOUNDING THE LATIN KINGDOM OF CONSTANTINOPLE.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Having conquered Constantinople and
presumably the empire hitherto ruled
from its palaces, it now devolved upon
the Latins to select an emperor from
their own race. Twelve electors were
chosen, six from the Venetians and six from the crusaders,
to whom was delegated the responsibility of
making the final choice. These met at the Church
of our Lady the Illuminator, which was located within
the walls of the palace of Bucolion. After celebration
of mass the electors took a solemn oath upon
the relics deposited in that church, that they would
bestow the crown upon him whom they regarded as
the ablest to defend and exalt their new possessions.
To silence any popular opposition to their choice, the
bravest of the guards were placed about the palace,
pledged to maintain the election.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were three, possibly four, preëminent candidates
for the imperial honor. Dandolo was recognized
as chief in ability, but he was far advanced in
years and could promise at best but a brief tenure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>the sceptre; besides, the Venetians themselves were
not agreed in asking for his elevation. If the doge
of Venice should have his capital in the East, Venice
herself, the queen of the Adriatic, would sink beneath
the splendors of the queen of the Bosporus. The
men who had exalted their city to that of chief
prominence in the maritime world were naturally
jealous of this transfer of prestige. Dandolo himself
was astute enough to foresee the danger and declined
to contest the election.</p>

<p class='c007'>Boniface, as head of the crusaders, was next in
prominence. He had, moreover, sought to make himself
more eligible by marrying Maria, the widow of
the late Emperor Isaac, that thus he might secure
the loyalty of the Greeks. But his election would
be fraught with disadvantage to Venice in that his
alliance would be first of all with his relative, Philip
of Swabia, and, in the event of the union of the East
with that German power, Venice would be politically
overshadowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is alleged by some writers that Philip himself
was proposed. He was at the time, as we have
stated, contesting the sceptre of Germany with Otho,
who had been approved by the Pope. Philip’s acquisition
of the Eastern sceptre might give him predominant
weight in the West and possibly convert
the Pope to his interests, especially as thus the union
of the churches would be facilitated. Thus the reasons
urged against Boniface were of equal force
against Philip.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dandolo declared his preference for Baldwin, Earl
of Flanders. This chieftain was but thirty-two years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>of age, a cousin of the King of France, and of the
blood of Charlemagne. He had proved his bravery
on many a field, and was, moreover, unobjectionable
to the more ardent among the crusaders from the
fact that, unlike Boniface, he had taken no active
part in originally diverting the movement from its
legitimate destination against Syria and Egypt. The
French, who were the majority in the host, sided
with him. Between the parties of Boniface and
Baldwin it was agreed that, in the event of either attaining
to the immediate government of the empire,
the other should acquire as his special dominion the
Peloponnesus and the Asiatic provinces beyond the
Bosporus.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the electors deliberated the crowd without
waited with anxiety. At midnight, May 9th, the
doors of the church were opened. The Bishop of
Soissons announced the decision: “This hour of the
night, which saw the birth of God, sees also the birth
of a new empire. We proclaim as emperor Earl
Baldwin of Flanders and Hainaut.” The successful
candidate was raised upon a shield and carried into
the church, where he was vested with the vermilion
buskins. A week later he was solemnly crowned in
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Sophia. At the coronation Boniface attended his
rival, carrying in the procession the royal robe of
cloth of gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Boniface’s loyalty scarcely endured the strain
put upon it. He soon exchanged the dominion of
the Peloponnesus and Asia Minor, which had been
assigned to him by the electors’ agreement, for that
of Salonica. Over this he and Baldwin incessantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>quarrelled. This strife between the leaders was the
indication of the dissensions everywhere among the
Latins in their greedy division of the estates of
the new realm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief actors in that stirring drama soon
passed off the scene. Baldwin was captured, and
probably murdered, by the Bulgarians before Adrianople
in 1205, and was succeeded by his brother
Henry. Dandolo, having acquired the title “Lord
of a Quarter and a Half of all the Roman World,”
died June, 1205. A slab recently discovered in <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Sophia is inscribed, “Henrico Dandolo,” and probably
marks his grave. With all his faults, the modern
Venetian might well cry with Byron:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, for one hour of blind old Dandolo,</div>
      <div class='line'>The octogenarian chief, Byzantium’s conquering foe!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Boniface two years later was mortally wounded in
a fight with the Bulgarians in the Rhodope Mountains.
Mourtzouphlos was soon taken prisoner and
hurled headlong from the column of Theodosius, thus
fulfilling a local prophecy relative to the column, that
it should witness the destruction of some perfidious
ruler.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not within our scope to narrate the history of
the Latin empire thus established. For fifty-seven
years it maintained a precarious existence, and finally
fell again into the hands of the Greeks, who had constantly
menaced it from their opposing capital of
Nicæa (1264).</p>

<p class='c007'>The most serious consequence of the capture of
Constantinople by the Latins was the new hope and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>opportunity imparted to the Turks. The Greeks,
with all their weaknesses, had for generations been a
buffer between Islam and Europe. The empire had
stood like a wall across the great highway of the
Asiatic incursion. If the Greeks had been generally
the losers in the struggle, they had maintained sufficient
power to occupy the arms of their contestants,
leaving the Christians of the West free to prey upon
the Moslems of Syria and adjacent countries. Now
all was changed in this respect. The war of Latins
with Greeks engrossed, and largely used up, the
power of both as against their common enemy.
Though the capital had fallen, the Greek everywhere
was still the sworn enemy of the Latin.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime the Moslems were compacting
and extending their military power. They were
growing in multitude by the migration of new swarms
from the original hive in the farther East. They
were destined to become too strong for Christendom
to resist, to move steadily on to their own conquest
of Constantinople, and even to knock at the gate of
Vienna. The words of Edward Pears are undoubtedly
warranted: “The crime of the fourth crusade
handed over Constantinople and the Balkan peninsula
to six centuries of barbarism.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>The campaign of Europe against Constantinople
wrought only evil among the
Christian colonists of Syria and Palestine.
In the time of their deepest need there
were diverted from their cause the enormous
sums of money that had been raised for their
succor, multitudes of brother warriors, whose swords
were sadly missed amid the daily menaces of their
foes, and the active sympathies, if not even the
prayers, of their coreligionists at home. Dire calamities
also fell upon them, which no human arm
could have prevented. The plague had followed the
terrible Egyptian famine of 1200, and spread its pall
far to the East. Earthquakes of the most terrific
sort changed the topography of many places; tidal
waves obliterated shore-lines; fortresses, like those
of Baalbec and Hamah, tottered to their fall upon
the unsteady earth; stately temples, which had
monumented the art and religion of antiquity, became
heaps of ruins; Nablous, Damascus, Tyre,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Tripoli, and Acre were shaken down. It would seem
that only the common prayers of Christians and
Mussulmans averted the calamity from Jerusalem,
the city that was sacred in the creed of both.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such sums of money as the cries for help brought
from Europe were expended first in repairing the
walls of Acre, into which service the Christians forced
their Moslem prisoners. Among the chain-gangs
thus set at work was the famous Sa’di, the greatest
of Persian poets, almost equally noted for his eloquence
as a preacher and for his adventures as a
traveller.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amaury, King of Jerusalem, died, leaving his useless
sceptre in the hands of his wife, Isabella, whose
demise passed it on to her daughter, Mary, by her
former husband, Conrad of Tyre. Such were the
burdens of the unsupported throne that none of the
warriors in the East ventured to assume the responsibility
of the new queen’s hand. A husband was
sought for her in Europe. John of Brienne was
nominated by Philip of France for the hazardous
nuptials. John had been a monk, but his adventurous
and martial spirit soon tired of the cowl. He
abandoned the austerities of a professional saint for
the freedom of the camp and the dangers of the field.
The romantic perils of wedding the dowerless queen
attracted him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rumors of a new crusade of gigantic proportions
led Malek-Ahdel to propose a renewal of the truce
with the Christians, which, though continually broken,
was in his estimation safer than an openly declared
war. The Hospitallers approved peace. This was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>sufficient to make their rivals, the Templars, eager
for the reverse, and the majority of the knights and
barons flew to arms against one another.</p>

<p class='c007'>John of Brienne reached Acre with a meagre following
of three hundred knights. His nuptials with
the young Queen Mary were rudely disturbed by
the Moslems, who besieged Ptolemaïs and swarmed
in threatening masses around Acre. In their straits
the Christians again appealed to Europe; but Christendom
was fully occupied with contentions within
its own borders. France was at war with England
to repossess the fair provinces which the Angevine
kings had wrested from her along the Atlantic. At
the same time she was pressing her conquests beyond
the Rhine against the Germans. Germany
was divided by the rival claimants for the imperial
sceptre, Otho and Philip of Swabia.</p>

<p class='c007'>A more serious diversion of interest from the
affairs of Palestine was due to the crusade under
Simon de Montfort against the Albigenses, whose
record makes one of the blackest pages of human
history. (See Dr. Vincent’s volume in this series.)
The Saracens in Spain were also threatening to overturn
the Christian kingdom of Castile, and were defeated
only with tremendous effort, which culminated
in the great battle of Tolosa (1212).</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1212 or 1213 occurred what is known as the
Children’s Crusade, a movement that doubtless has
been greatly exaggerated by after writers, but the
facts of which illustrate the ignorance and credulity,
as well as the adventurous, not to say marauding,
spirit of the times. If in our day the free circulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>of stories relating the adventures of cutthroats and
robbers inflames the passions and engenders lawless
conceits in the young, we may imagine that reports
of the bloody work done by persecutors of the Albigenses,
dastardly and cruel deeds, which were applauded
by Pope and people, could not but make a
similar impression upon the callow mind of childhood
in the middle ages. Boys practised the sword-thrust
at one another’s throats, built their pile of fagots
about the stake of some imaginary heretic, and
charged in mimic brigades upon phantom hosts of
Infidels. It needed only the impassioned appeals of
unwise preachers to start the avalanche thus trembling
on the slope. It was proclaimed that supernal
powers waited to strengthen the children’s arms.
The lads were all to prove Davids going forth against
Goliaths; the girls would become new Judiths and
Deborahs without waiting for their growth. It was
especially revealed that the Mediterranean from
Genoa to Joppa would be dried up so that these
children of God could pass through it dry-shod.</p>

<p class='c007'>From towns and cities issued bands of boys and
girls, who in response to the question, “Whither are
you going?” replied, “To Jerusalem.” “Boy
preachers” were universally encouraged to proclaim
the crusade. One lad, named Stephen, announcing
that Christ had visited him, led hundreds away. A
boy named Nicholas, instigated by older persons,
deluded a company into crossing the Alps, where
many starved, were killed, or kidnapped. The real
leaders, however, seem to have been men and women
of disorderly habits, who in an age of impoverished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>homes readily adopted the lives of tramps, and used
the pitiable appearance of the children to secure the
charities of the towns and cities they passed through.
Saracen kidnappers also took advantage of the craze
to lure children on board of ships by promise of free
passage to the Holy Land. Thus entrapped, they
were sold as slaves for Eastern fields or harems.
Seven vessels were loaded with Christian children at
Marseilles. Five of the ships reached Egypt, consigned
to slave merchants; two were wrecked off the
isle of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter, where Pope Gregory <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> afterwards
caused a church to be built in memory of the victims.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE FIFTH CRUSADE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='chap40' class='c008'>CHAPTER <abbr title='forty'>XL.</abbr> <br> DISASTER OF MARIETTA.</h3>
<p class='c006'>Pope Innocent <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> comforted himself
for this “slaughter of the innocents” by
making the incident the basis of a new
appeal for the relief of Palestine. “These
children,” said he, “reproach us with
being asleep while they were flying to the assistance
of the Holy Land.” In his exhortation to Europe
the Holy Father ventures to interpret the mysterious
prediction of the Book of Revelation regarding the
duration of the Antichrist symbolized by the beast.
Some Protestants have presumptuously applied the
figures to the destiny of the Roman Church. Innocent
regarded Mohammedanism as meant, and,
counting from the hejira of Mohammed (622) to his
own day, announced to the people, in the name of
God, whose infallible vicegerent he was, “The power
of Mohammed draws towards its end; for that power
is nothing but the beast of the Apocalypse, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>not to extend beyond the number of six hundred and
sixty-six years, and already six hundred have been
accomplished.” Europe was asked to believe that the
marshalled nations of the East, then so threatening,
would only furnish the funeral cortège of Antichrist,
after which the world would enter upon its millennium
of peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every crowned head, every noble, every knight,
every city, every church, received its especial appeal
from Rome to offer men, ships, money, and incessant
prayers for this last holy adventure. With equal
assurance Innocent addressed letters to the sultans
of Damascus and Cairo, giving them an opportunity
to voluntarily restore the holy places before the final
vengeance of the Lord. Ardent orators, like Cardinal
Courçon and James of Vitri (an original chronicler
of these events), went everywhere, firing the
passions of the people. Philip Augustus appropriated
for the project two and a half per cent. of the territorial
revenue of France. King John of England
promised to make amends for his many sins by taking
the cross; he was the more inclined to this from
the fact that his barons had just wrenched from him
Magna Charta, and the Pope had put him under excommunication;
his pretence of piety was the policy
of the moment. Frederick <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> of Germany, to secure
the papal favor in his contest with Otho for the imperial
throne, assumed the rôle of a crusader.</p>

<p class='c007'>The movement was, however, halted by the affairs
in France. England, Flanders, Holland, Boulogne,
with the aid of the German Otho, invaded France.
At the battle of Bouvines (1214) this combination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>was overthrown, and the French monarchy, with restored
territory and prestige, assumed the independence
which it maintained until recent times.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1215 the Lateran Council issued the grand
order for the crusading expedition. The Pope and
cardinals taxed themselves a tenth of their income,
and all ecclesiastics a twentieth. So great was the
excitement for war that two astounding phenomena
were observed: luminous crosses appeared in the
heavens, and the Troubadours sang only of battle, no
longer of love. Innocent <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> proposed to head the
crusade in person, but when his example had wrought
its full influence discreetly retired from the leadership.
Shortly after he died, and Honorius <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> came into
the pontificate.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1217 the mighty armament was in motion.
Andrew <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, King of Hungary, was designated chief.
Germany, under its representative dukes of Bavaria
and Austria, followed in his train. The host was
augmented by those from Italy and France and the
islands of the Mediterranean. According to the
Arabian historian, it was the largest force ever at one
time pitted against them in Palestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The army landed at Acre. The new soldiers signalled
their arrival by an impressive exhibition of
their pilgrim zeal. They formed an immense procession.
At their head was the Patriarch of Jerusalem,
who bore aloft a piece of wood which had been
surreptitiously cut from the True Cross at the time
it was captured by Saladin at Hattîn. With utmost
pomp they passed over the land from the sea to the
Jordan, bathed in the waters of the sacred river, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>lingered to pray amid the ruins on the shores of the
Sea of Tiberias. They gathered many relics, and did
not hesitate to take as their pious plunder many of
the people of the land, whom they brought with them
as prisoners to Acre.</p>

<p class='c007'>No enemy molested them. Malek-Ahdel had advised
that the invaders be left to their own dissensions,
which, judging from previous observation, were
sure to follow as soon as they should attempt to divide
the spoil they might take. The martial spirit of
the Christians did not resent this idleness, and stagnation
of energy bred moral malaria. Camp vices
thrived to such an extent that the leaders were forced
to drive out the soldiers in search of manly adventures.
Mount Tabor, the Mount of Transfiguration,
lifted high its head, crowned with Moslem forts
in place of the Church of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Helena and of the two
monasteries which had formerly commemorated the
tabernacles of Moses and Elias. The crusaders were
ordered to capture the holy mountain. That all
doubt of Heaven’s favor in the enterprise might be
removed, the patriarch read the gospel for the day,
first Sunday in Advent, and interpreted the words,
“Go ye into the village over against you,” to mean
the castle on Tabor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Led by this high dignitary, who carried the ubiquitous
piece of the True Cross, they made the ascent
through a shower of Moslem arrows and an avalanche
of stones. The defenders at first retired within their
citadel, but an unaccountable panic seized the assailants:
they deserted their own cause at the moment
of victory, and made a disorderly retreat down to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>plain. Their piety was, however, compensated by
the capture of a number of women and children,
whom they forced to be baptized. The anticipated
dissensions followed. Each leader reproached the
others. On Christmas eve a terrific storm swept
the camp, which, in the general discouragement, they
attributed to the displeasure of Heaven. Lack of
provisions forced them to encamp in different neighborhoods—Tripoli,
Acre, Mount Carmel, and the
plains of Cæsarea. The commander-in-chief, the
King of Hungary, returned to Europe, consoling
himself for lack of martial laurels by the possession
of the head of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter, the hand of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Thomas, and
one of the seven water-jars in which Christ had made
water wine at Cana. The sacred relics did not,
however, prevent his subsequent excommunication.</p>

<p class='c007'>This crusade was saved from utter and ignominious
failure only by the arrival of fresh enthusiasts from
the West. Bands from Friesland and the banks of
the Rhine had taken ships on the Baltic and coasted
by France and Portugal. They told of the luminous
crosses which appeared in the heavens and signalled
them by moving towards the East, and how squadrons
of angels had fought with them against the
Moors on the Tagus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The courage of their brethren was thus rekindled
to venture at the opening of spring (1218) upon an
invasion of Egypt. The chronicler tells us of a
favorable omen here observed by the crusaders: the
water of the Nile, which was sweet to the taste on
their arrival, afterwards became salt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The city of Damietta was guarded by a strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>tower, which rose from the middle of the Nile, and
was connected with the walls by an immense chain
which impeded the passage of ships. The crusaders
attacked this unavailingly. There were in the host
certain skilled mechanics, who, “by the inspiration
of the Almighty,” constructed an enormous wooden
tower, which floated upon two vessels and overtopped
the walls of the great citadel. In vain did the Moslems
set fire to this with streams of liquid flame.
The prayers of the monks on the shore, together with
the “tears of the faithful,” and, we may add, the
abundant oblation of the buckets, soon subdued the
conflagration. The huge drawbridge which dropped
from the top of the floating tower successfully landed
upon the walls three hundred brave knights. Their
valor, together with the spiritual prowess of the
patriarch, who lay stretched on the ground wrestling
with the will of Heaven, was resistless, and soon the
flag of the Duke of Austria was flying from the ramparts;
not, however, until the usual band of celestial
knights in white armor had dazzled the eyes of the
Moslems, so that they could not see where to strike
their foes. This was on August 24th, which, being
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s day, enabled the crusaders also to
see that saint, clad in red, at the head of their celestial
assistants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mastering the tower of the Nile and breaking the
chain which obstructed the channel, the Christian
fleet lay close to the walls of the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seventeen months were destined to pass in the
siege of Damietta. In September Malek-Ahdel died.
He had before formally laid down the chieftainship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>and divided his realm among his many sons; but his
prestige and continually sought counsel made him
until his death the virtual head of the Moslem power.
He maintained a sumptuous court and a splendid
palace, the recesses of which were regarded by the
faithful as a sanctuary where Heaven daily blessed its
favorite son. The various courts saluted him as “king
of kings,” and the camps hailed him as saphadin, the
“sword of religion.” His death threw a shadow
upon the Moslem world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of taking advantage of this providence, the
Christians seemed to emulate the divisions of their
enemies. Many grew weary of the task they had
vowed to Heaven, and returned to Europe. The
priests pronounced a curse upon the deserters. This
malediction was regarded as inspired when it was
learned that six thousand of the crusaders from
Brittany had been wrecked off the coast of Italy, and
that the returning Frieslanders reached their homes
only to witness the wrath of the North Sea, which
broke the Holland dikes, submerged their richest
provinces and cities, and drowned one hundred thousand
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>But new warriors were excited to redeem the opportunity.
France and England sent much of their
best blood and many of their most famous names.
Among the multitude of celebrities was one who was
destined to bring the entire crusade to a fatal ending.
Cardinal Pelagius was delegated as papal legate.
He was a man of arrogance, and asserted his right to
supersede even John of Brienne, the King of Jerusalem,
in the military command. This position was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>refused him by the soldiery. He at length accomplished
his ambition by threatening all who opposed
him with excommunication.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coming of these auxiliaries spurred the Christians
to take advantage of contentions among the
Moslems and make a forward movement. They
crossed from the west bank of the Nile and invested
Damietta. The menace reunited the Infidels. Battles
were of daily occurrence, in which whole battalions,
now of Christians, now of Moslems, were driven
into the Nile, and perished.</p>

<p class='c007'>One beautiful episode redeemed these hellish
scenes. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis of Assisi visited the camps; he
went among his brethren with consolations for the
sick and wounded, his presence redolent with heavenly
charity. No labors could weary this man, who
already seemed divested largely of his physical nature,
and to be sustained only by the power of his inward
spirit. His zeal for God led him to visit even the
camp of the Moslems. He preached his doctrines
before Malek-Kamel, the Sultan of Cairo; he alternately
threatened the sultan’s infidelity with the
pains of hell, and sought to win his better faith by
promises of heaven. Francis proposed to test the
truth of either religion by passing with the holiest
Moslems through an ordeal of fire. This being declined,
he offered himself to the flame, provided that
the sultan’s conversion should follow the refusal of
fire to burn the representative of the faith of Christ.
With courteous words the test was declined. Moslems
reverenced insane persons as in some way under
a divine influence; Malek-Kamel treated his uninvited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>guest as one of this sort. The Moslem doctors
of the law commanded Malek-Kamel to take off the
head of the intruder, but the warrior was either too
much amused with the simplicity, or too much
amazed at the sincerity, of his visitor to harm him,
and dismissed him with presents, which, however,
Francis’ vow of poverty would not allow him to
accept.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether persuaded by the holy eloquence of the
saint, or by the rumor that Frederick of Germany
was approaching with fresh armies, the sultan proposed
peace. He offered the flattering condition of
giving up Jerusalem to the Christians. The warriors
would have assented thus to secure as the reward of
their valor that which had been the object of the
entire crusade; but Cardinal Pelagius forbade, in the
name of the Holy Father, the cessation of arms at
any less price than the entire subjugation of the
Moslem power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Damietta was therefore more closely invested; its
garrison was reduced to starvation. To prevent possible
defection among his miserable soldiers, the commander
of Damietta walled up the gates of the city.
The Christians made an assault in full force; the rams
battered the trembling towers; ladders swarmed with
assailants; no one opposed them. Sweeping over
the ramparts with naked swords, they found the
streets and houses filled with the dead. Of seventy
thousand scarcely three thousand of the inhabitants
had remained alive. The air was fraught with
poisonous stench from the decaying corpses; as the
chronicler says, “the dead had killed the living.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>The crusaders could abide only long enough to
gather the booty, and left the city to be cleansed
by carrion-birds and the air of heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'>This temporary success of his policy inflamed the
conceit of Cardinal Pelagius. According to his own
people, the “King of kings and Lord of lords” had
given him the city; “under the guidance of Christ”
the soldiers had scaled the walls. The victors took
as their reward the rich plunder of the place, and
gratefully “baptized all the children who were found
alive in the city, thereby giving to God the first-fruit
of souls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moslems, afflicted by these reverses, enlarged
their conditions of peace to the yielding up, not only
of Jerusalem, but all the Holy Land. The cardinal
refused even these terms, and proposed to march to
the capture of Cairo, the capital of Egypt. In vain
did the military leaders protest against that which
they esteemed impracticable in itself, and which, in
the event of its success, would leave on their hands
a land which they could not hope to defend against
the myriads who were swarming from all parts of
the Moslem world. The cardinal accused the warriors
of timidity and irreligion. This was too much
for John of Brienne, who would have dared to sheathe
his good sword in the bowels of Lucifer himself.
Orders for the ascent of the Nile were given. At
the junction of its two branches, the southern extreme
of the Delta, the Moslems made their fortified
camp, and built what has since been known as the
city of Mansourah. The enemy approached; once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>more the sultan offered peace, including now the gift
of the Delta, together with the previously offered
conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The refusal of this exhausted the patience, not only
of the sultan, but seemingly of Heaven also. With
the rising of the Nile the Moslems opened the sluices,
flooded all the canals of Lower Egypt, and inundated
the Christians’ camp. Simultaneously the Moslem
ships made their way up through the canals and destroyed
the vessels of their foes. The Infidels occupied
every rising knoll; “while,” says a letter from
the camp, “we were thus caught in the midst of the
waters like fish in a net.” In vain did the Christians
endeavor to force a battle. Shrewdly retreating from
the arbitrament of the sword, the Moslems left the
invaders to the destruction which they proclaimed
Allah had prepared for His insolent adversaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cardinal Pelagius now begged for the peace he
had despised; nor did he stop with the old conditions.
He would yield all he had taken or claimed, if only
he might be permitted to lead the armies of Europe
safely into the walls of distant Acre. This capitulation
was reluctantly accepted by the Sultan of Cairo.
The haughty cardinal, the brave King John of Brienne,
the Duke of Bavaria, and many of the nobles
meditated their disgrace as hostages in the hostile
camp, while the Christian soldiers were still waiting
the will of their conqueror in the marshes. King
John of Brienne one day sat down at the feet of the
sultan and burst into tears. The Moslem respected
his courage and was grieved at the distress which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>seemingly had shaken it. “Why do you weep?” he
asked. “To see my brave people perishing with
hunger amid the waters.” The sultan immediately
provisioned the Christian camp, and sent his own son
to conduct the host in safety out of the land they
had come to conquer (autumn, 1221).</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE SIXTH CRUSADE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='chap41' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='forty-one'>XLI.</abbr> <br> FREDERICK <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> AND POPE GREGORY <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr></h3>
<p class='c006'>Seven years elapsed before another attempt
worthy of record was made for the
recapture of Palestine. Frederick <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>
(Hohenstaufen) of Germany was its leader;
hero it had none.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frederick was one of the ablest men of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries, though not meriting the
title given him by an English chronicler, “the Wonder
of the World.” The grandson of Frederick Barbarossa,
son of Henry <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr> and Constance of Sicily,
he united in his person the strongest traits of German
and Italian stock. Born in 1194, at two years
of age he was elected king of the Romans, and in
his fourth year was crowned King of Sicily. Pope
Innocent <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> was the guardian of his childhood, and
well discharged his duty, if the rare education of
Frederick may be taken as evidence. The royal
youth mastered Latin, Greek, French, German, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>knew something of Arabic and Hebrew; he was
creditably versed in Saracenic science and arts, as
well as in Christian philosophy and scholasticism; he
wrote well on the habits of birds, and shared with
the Troubadours the joys of the poet’s art; he endowed
universities, patronized painters, and encouraged
architects. In government he deserves to rank
among the empire-builders, for in a narrow age he
extended the scope of law for the toleration of Jews
and Mohammedans, for the emancipation of peasants
from undue oppression at the hands of the upper
classes, and for the enlargement of international
commerce almost to the line of the modern theory of
free trade. His liberality towards Moslems brought
him the accusation of harboring in his heart a secret
infidelity, which his severity with the Christian
schismatics could not entirely dispel.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the age of eighteen Frederick entered into
contest for the imperial throne of Germany, and in
1215, at the age of twenty-one, won the crown of
Charlemagne. In order to accomplish this grand
object, he had, as a first step, secured the alliance of
the Pope. This he did by pledging, among other
things, to lead a crusade; but the pressing emergencies
of his new crown caused delay from year to
year. In 1225 he married Iolante, the daughter of
John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem. He at once
asserted that John held his crown only in virtue of
being the husband of Queen Mary, and this lady
having died, her daughter, Iolante, was lawful sovereign.
Thus by marriage he annexed to his German
title that of King of Jerusalem, and was looked to by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>all for the defence of his new dominion. But two years
later (1227) he was still too busy unravelling European
complications to absent himself in the distant East.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this year Gregory <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> ascended the papal
throne. While this Pope still retained the faculties
and ambition of youth, he had developed also the
obstinacy and petulance of old age. By his unwise
dealing with the German emperor, and the impolitic
assertion of his own capricious will as of divine authority,
he may be said to have started the decadence
of the papal throne, which in another generation
was destined to lose the prestige of the Hildebrandian
policy and all prospect of becoming the world monarchy.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the day of his accession to power Gregory <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr>
issued a proclamation for all the sovereigns of Christendom
to unite in a new crusade, and openly
threatened Frederick with his ecclesiastical vengeance
if he longer postponed the fulfilment of his
vow. He accused the emperor’s delay with being
due to luxury, if not sensuality, in living. The former
charge probably had in it a measure of truth, for
Frederick’s court at Palermo, where he spent more
time than in his northern capital, was the centre of
gayety, not only among the Christians, but to a certain
extent for Mohammedans. Many of the fairest
women of Asia and North Africa graced his salons.
It might also be imagined of Frederick that his faith
was not of that intense and credulous nature which
foresaw a heavenly crown awaiting his exploits in the
Holy Land. Equally detrimental to his repute for
crusading zeal were the courtesies he was exchanging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>with Malek-Kamel, Sultan of Egypt. It was even
rumored that he had made alliance with this sultan,
pledging help against the rival Sultan of Damascus,
on condition of the restoration of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the sincerity of Frederick was proved by the
gathering of his fleets and the massing of his armaments
at Otranto. The fame of his leadership attracted
the noblest of Germany. Among them was
Ludwig, Landgrave of Thuringia, noted for having
won the hand of Elizabeth, daughter of Andrew <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>
of Hungary, who in her girlhood had attained
renown for her asceticism and charities, and died
(1231) at the age of twenty-four, to be canonized as
the fairest saint of the middle ages. From distant
England many came at Frederick’s call, and further
impelled by visions of the Saviour on the cross of
fire which appeared in that northern sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>The season was intensely hot, and gendered a
fever fatal to the crusaders who were gathered in
southern Italy. Among its victims was Ludwig,
leaving his faithful spouse to keep his memory revered
by her refusal to marry any one of the numerous
kings who were attracted to her feet. Many bishops
and thousands of pilgrims succumbed to this plague.
Frederick sailed, but only to return in three days,
seeking hospital in Otranto.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pope Gregory <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> fulminated against Frederick all
the terrors of his personal scorn and ecclesiastical
vengeance. From his pulpit he pictured him “breaking
all his promises, bursting every bond, trampling
underfoot the fear of God, despising all reverence for
Jesus Christ, scorning the censures of the church,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>deserting the Christian army, abandoning the Holy
Land to unbelievers, to his own disgrace and that
of all Christendom withdrawing to the luxury and
wonted delights of his kingdom, and seeking to palliate
his offence by frivolous excuses of simulated
sickness.” Then, while the cathedral bells were
clanging a demoniacal accompaniment to what was
transpiring beneath them, the clergy stood with
lighted torches around the altar. Gregory invoked
the eternal curse of God upon his imperial victim.
The clergy dashed their torches and extinguished
them upon the floor, in token of the “blackness of
darkness forever” which should settle upon the emperor’s
soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>The news of this anathema excited the minds of
the common people to such a degree that they saw
all sorts of signs of Heaven’s disapproval of the
crowned Judas; such as bloody crosses, on which the
Saviour was dying afresh, “as if laying a complaint
before each and every Christian.” Frederick made a
quick retort to the papal fulmination, in which he advised
all temporal princes to beware of the unscrupulous
domination of the Roman hierarchy. He closed
a letter to the princes of Europe with these words of
an old couplet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Give heed when neighboring houses burn,</div>
      <div class='line'>For next, perhaps, may be your turn.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Pope, having generated a fresh supply of gall,
discharged it in an interdict by which all subjects of
Frederick should be deprived of the ministrations of
religion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>The emperor, in order to prove the injustice of the
Pope’s assault upon him and the falsity of the accusation
that he had feigned sickness, prepared to
resume the crusade, taking, however, his own time
and way. His armaments were repaired. He summoned
all the dignitaries of his kingdom to meet him
at Baroli (April, 1228). There, in the presence of a
vast multitude, he declared his will regarding the
succession in the event of his not returning alive,
and exhorted his people to live in peace during his
absence. The Pope now became not less violent in
denouncing the crusade than he had been previously
in urging it, on the ground that its leader was excommunicate.
He refused to recognize it as a holy
war, and stigmatized it as an expedition of piracy.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a small army of six hundred knights Frederick
sailed for Acre (September, 1228). Two Franciscan
monks in a swift bark outsped him, and aroused
Palestine against the coming of such a champion.
The partisans of John of Brienne refused to recognize
the kingship of his son-in-law. Templars and
Hospitallers were jealous of the new hand in affairs,
and refused to serve under him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frederick then pursued his old friendship with
Malek-Kamel. Speaking Arabic, he discussed with
the emirs philosophy and astrology, and sent difficult
questions to the sultan, reminding the chroniclers of
the converse of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.
The ladies of the Christian and Moslem courts
mingled, say the papal apologists, to the mutual disadvantage
of the morals of both. The emperor desired
to make a pious pilgrimage to the Jordan. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Templars sent a letter to the sultan, suggesting his
capture. The sultan delivered the missive into the
hands of Frederick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such exchange of courtesies was only preliminary
to a treaty by which the astuteness of the emperor
won the kingdom of Jerusalem without drawing his
sword. It was stipulated that Bethlehem, Nazareth,
and the Holy City, with the exception of the Temple
Mount, which was occupied by the mosque of Omar,
should be given to the Christians for ten years. In
a letter to the King of England Frederick wrote how,
“in a few days, by a miracle rather than by strength,
that business hath been brought to a conclusion which
for a length of time past many chiefs and rulers of
the world, among the multitude of nations, have
never been able till now to accomplish by force,
however great, nor by fear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fury of the papal party knew no bounds.
That the Infidel should retain a spot for worship was
in their eyes a sacrilege; that a man under papal displeasure
should be recognized as king in Jerusalem
was an impiety which Heaven should punish. The
city of Jerusalem was put under the ban. Pilgrims
were forbidden by the Holy Father to pray at the
sepulchre of our Lord, for which purpose, with the
Pope’s encouragement, they had left their homes,
and in many cases sacrificed their earthly all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frederick repaired in great state to the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre for his coronation (March 18,
1229). No priest ventured to celebrate the mass or
pronounce a blessing upon the accursed of the church;
the silence was unbroken except by the clang of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>armor; the images of the apostles were veiled that
they might not look upon the reprobate. Frederick
took the crown from the altar with his own hands and
placed it upon his head; then was read in his name a
formal exculpation of the Pope for his persecution,
on the ground of the Holy Father’s ignorance of his
motives and conduct; he also announced his humiliation
before God and His vicar for his crown. With
more catholicity he visited the same day the mosque
of Omar. A muezzin, whose station was near the
emperor’s house, by order of the kadi omitted the
usual call to prayer, lest it should give offence to his
Christian Majesty. Frederick gently rebuked the
Moslem official: “You are wrong to neglect, on my
account, your duty, your law, and your religion. If
you should visit my realm, you would find no such
respectful deference.” A priest had brought into the
mosque a copy of the Gospels. Frederick rebuked
this as an insult to his allies, saying, “Here we are
all the servants of the sultan; it is he that has restored
to us our churches.” The emperor then retired to
Acre. The papal interdict upon all people among
whom he should find abode followed him. The
churches of Acre were unopened; the sick were refused
consolation in their homes, and the dead were
buried, without funeral service, in the fields.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture news from Europe urged the emperor’s
return home. John of Brienne, his father-in-law,
was ravaging the kingdom of Naples. The
Pope was filling all Christendom with denunciations,
and plotting that the imperial crown itself might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>taken from the head of the man who, by the treaty
with the Moslems, had effected “reconciliation of
Christ and Belial.” The Moslem world simultaneously
rang with as bitter denunciation of the act of
Malek-Kamel in surrendering the sacred city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, amid the universal confusion produced by
his aim to establish peace, Frederick returned to the
West. With a popularity which the ban of Rome
could not destroy, after crushing his enemies in the
field he engaged in the work of giving to his people
better laws, and stimulating the new civilization
which was everywhere appearing as the Dark Ages
were wearing away.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the retirement of Frederick from Palestine
the Christians were reduced to utmost extremity.
Notwithstanding the treaty, constant collisions occurred
between the Moslem and Christian bigots.
The great bell of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
often rang its alarm. The pilgrims generally sought
safety in the fortress of David, or in more obscure
retreats in the neighborhood of Jerusalem; their
cries again afflicted their brethren in Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Pope convoked an assembly at Spoleto, at
which it was determined to ignore Frederick’s truce
with the Sultan of Cairo, and renew the war. Special
agents of the holy see visited the various courts;
monks and orators went everywhere, preaching the
necessity of dyeing the cross anew in the blood of
unbelievers. The followers of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Dominic were diverted from their legitimate and
honorable work of charity to act as the collectors of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>a war fund. Troubadours, headed by Thibaut <abbr title='the fifth'>V.</abbr>,
King of Navarre, sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Heaven is closed to those who will not cross the sea,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>and urged in rhythmic piety the exchange of earthly
amours for the service of the Virgin:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My Lady lost, Lady, be thou my aid.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The war upon the helpless Albigenses having
come to an end from the extermination of its victims,
many soldiers were impatient of new service to appease
their sharply whetted appetite for blood. Thus
a multitude was enrolled for a new crusade.</p>

<p class='c007'>But a diverting cry came from a different direction.
The Latin empire at Constantinople was falling.
First Lascaris and then Vataces had for years kept
the Greeks well in hand, and they now assailed the
walls of the capital. John of Brienne was called to
the tottering throne. As everywhere during his long
career, so now at the age of eighty years this man
showed splendid qualities on the field, but died without
effectually driving away the foe. His son-in-law,
Baldwin, succeeded him to a barren sceptre, and
visited Europe in piteous entreaty for help.</p>

<p class='c007'>This call would have been sufficient in itself to
divert much of the energy of the crusaders; but the
Pope, now far gone in senility, further embarrassed
affairs by commanding the warriors to return to their
homes. This order went far towards depreciating
the Pope in popular reverence. Those assembled at
Lyons replied to the papal message: “Whence arises
this fickleness in the Roman court? According to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>the promises of the preachers we have prepared ourselves
in God’s behalf; we have sold or pledged our
lands, taken leave of friends, sent our money to the
Holy Land in advance. Why do our pastors change
their tone and rise against us?” With difficulty
were they restrained from doing violence to the papal
agents. The Pope, however, remained inexorable,
and threatened all who proceeded with the crusade
that “they should not enjoy the indulgence for their
sins which had been granted them.” Some urged
the sacredness of their crusaders’ vow. This scruple
the Pope readily turned to the account of his treasury
by absolving such from their pledge upon payment
of a sum of money equal to that required to provision
themselves for the voyage, whence “great scandal
and schism arose among the people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Emperor Frederick also proposed that the
expedition should be postponed until, with the rallied
forces of his empire, he might give it better assurance
of success. Pope and emperor revived their strifes,
and Italy was turned into pandemonium. A few of
the more ardent managed to escape the entanglements
at home for more honorable adventures in the
East. The King of Navarre, the dukes of Brittany
and Burgundy, reached Syria (August, 1239) and
performed exploits sufficient to more thoroughly
enrage, but not to awe, the Moslems. In 1240 Richard
of Cornwall, with a band of English, sailing in
spite of the Pope’s prohibition, landed at Acre, made
several raids through Turkish territory, and returned,
having gained nothing but a continuance of the truce
with the sultan.</p>

  <h3 id='chap42' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='forty-two'>XLII.</abbr> <br> BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH CRUSADES—THE TARTARS—THE CARISMIAN INVASION.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>By a strange providence the sacred places
of Palestine were destined to fall for a
while into other hands than any of the
former great contestants, Christian, Saracen,
or Turk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most astounding events of the thirteenth century
were in connection with the great Tartar irruption.
The Mogul hosts under Genghis Khan, or
“king of kings,” had broken eastward across the Great
Wall of China, and poured a tide of desolation over
that ancient empire. As the bloody waves returned,
they moved with undiminished force westward and
southward, flooding all Turkestan, and all lands to the
borders of India and the Persian Gulf. These armies,
numbering seven hundred thousand warriors, courageous,
remorseless, and cruel as tigers, were met by
five hundred thousand under Mohammed, Sultan of
Carismia. But even this latter tremendous host
could not withstand the impact of the Tartars.
Under Octai, son of Genghis Khan, they crossed the
Volga and conquered vast sections of Russia, laying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>Moscow and Kiew in ashes. Poland fell next. Even
the Baltic monumented the fury of the Tartars with
a circle of ruined towers and devastated country
which marked its shores.</p>

<p class='c007'>Matthew Paris describes the terror these Tartars
inspired even in England, where they were thought
to be “a people of monstrous shape, drinking blood
warm from the veins of their victims, eating raw
flesh, even of human beings, mounted upon enormous
horses, which fed upon leaves and trees.” Their
home was presumed to be the Caspian Mountains, the
tops of which God had united and thus shut them in,
until now they were let loose to be the scourge of
mankind. The extreme terror spread by the rumor
of their coming was such that the herring fisheries
off Yarmouth were abandoned, lest the sailors should
be caught by these monsters, who could sweep the
waves with their ox-hide boats. Their skill in swimming
was of such renown that the lone fisherman of
Friesland was alert lest he should “catch a Tartar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the battle of Liegnitz the prowess of Europe
proved impotent against the Tartar invasion which
swept Hungary. Settled communities were annihilated;
nomadic peoples sought safety in migrating.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Carismians, beaten back by the Tartars, spread
themselves through Asia Minor and Syria; but these
fugitives were almost as terrible a menace as their
pursuers had been. They carried with them the
spoil of the lands they traversed. Dreading death
less than the disgrace of retreat, trained to neither
give nor take quarter, waving from their spear-heads
the hair of the slaughtered, they assaulted all peoples,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>Mussulmans and Christians alike. These nations
were forced by the new menace to lay aside their
ancient animosities and unite in a struggle for existence
against the common foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sultan of Cairo, however, deemed that his
policy lay in a different direction, and made alliance
with the invaders, promising to them the free spoil
of Palestine in exchange for the immunity of his
Egyptian possessions. Twenty thousand Carismian
horsemen ravaged Tripoli and Galilee and appeared
suddenly before Jerusalem. The inhabitants fled;
the few who remained were indiscriminately massacred.
Finding nothing left to appease the appetite
of their swords, the conquerors unfurled the banner
of the cross from the walls and rang the bells of the
churches, thus luring back to the city a multitude of
the fugitives, upon whom they satiated their cruelty.
Seven thousand of these helpless creatures perished
at the gates. Not satisfied with the spoil of the living,
the Carismians rifled the abodes of the dead.
Sepulchres which had been respected by the Moslem
occupants for a century were ruthlessly despoiled.
The contents of the alleged tomb of Christ, together
with those of the kings of Jerusalem from the days
of Godfrey, were given to the flames.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Christian and Moslem armies massed against
this remorseless foe in the neighborhood of Gaza.
For two days there raged as fearful carnage as has
ever dyed the pages of history; but nothing could
stay this host of fiends. Thirty thousand men, who
had entered the battle with prayers in the name of
Jesus or Mohammed, perished or were taken prisoners.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>But four Templars, twenty-six Hospitallers,
and three Teutonic Knights remained to tell
the story of their useless valor. The heroism of
Gautier of Brienne, Lord of Jaffa, deserves to be
chronicled. Captured by the enemy, he was fastened
upon a cross and brought close to the walls of the
town which the Carismians were besieging. He was
offered his life on condition of his counselling the
place to surrender. To the people who thronged
the walls he cried with a loud voice, “Your duty is
to fight; mine is to die for you and Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Carismians, though they were able to conquer,
had no ability to hold their conquests. Like
most semicivilized hordes, they reaped what they
found, but had no enterprise to sow again for other
harvests. They quickly quarrelled with their ally,
the Sultan of Cairo. New combinations were made
against them, and in a few years they disappeared
from history, merged, doubtless, with other peoples
whose home lands they shared.</p>
<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE SEVENTH CRUSADE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='chap43' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='forty-three'>XLIII.</abbr> <br> <abbr title='Saint'>ST.</abbr> LOUIS.</h3>
<p class='c006'>The news of the Carismian invasion of
Palestine reduced Europe to a condition
of panic. It came on the heels of other
adversities, which had shaken the stoutest
hearts. The Latin empire at Constantinople,
as we have noted, was again on the verge of
falling into the hands of the Greeks. The Tartars
were ravaging the Danube, and threatening the domain
of the Emperor Frederick <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> Terror paralyzed
trade, travel, and social intercourse everywhere; even
in Italy and along the borders of France fear fed the
imagination that an army of demi-demons was about
to appear. The rustling of the woods, the soughing
of the winds, forest fires, the dust raised by storms,
strange cloud shapes on the horizon, were omens, if not
the signs, of the advance of this horde let loose from
hell. Pope Innocent <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr> called a council at Lyons.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>In his opening address he spoke of the five wounds
of the Saviour, which he likened to five griefs that
afflicted him as the Vicegerent of Christ. These were
the Tartar menace, the Greek schism, the Carismian
conquest of Palestine, the relaxation of ecclesiastical
discipline and progress of heresy, and, finally, as if it
were the climax of the woes of Christendom, the obduracy
of the Emperor Frederick <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> in opposing the
papal schemes. The Holy Father could weep over
the wickedness of Tartars, Carismians, and Moslems,
but he could only rage against Frederick. His spirit
communicated itself to his prelates. Under his direction
they passed resolutions advising the Germans
to dig trenches and build walls against the Tartars;
they also calmly proposed a crusade against the Infidels;
but, with more evidence of deep feeling, they
bent to the floor, dashed out the lights of their candles,
and repeated with sepulchral voices the amen
to the papal anathema of the foremost Christian
monarch in the world. The Pope’s fulmination concluded
with these words: “I forbid any, under pain
of excommunication, to henceforth yield him obedience.
I command the electors to elect another emperor,
and I reserve to myself the right of disposing
of his kingdom of Sicily.” This was the glory of
the so-called Ecumenical Council of Lyons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frederick, on hearing of the outrage perpetrated
upon him, called for his crown, and, placing it upon
his head, exclaimed; “There it is; and before it shall
be wrested from me my enemies shall know the terror
of my arms. Let this pontiff tremble, who has
broken every tie that bound me to him.” From
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>that day, as history shows, the popes lost power ever
again to lead united Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>But for the pious zeal of one man, it is not probable
that another crusading host would ever have set
out against the Moslem.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero of the seventh crusade was Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr>,
the “Good <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Louis” of France. He was the son
of Louis <abbr title='the eighth'>VIII.</abbr>, who, Guizot says, “added to the history
of France no glory, save that of having been the
son of Philip Augustus, the husband of Blanche of
Castile, and the father of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Louis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Blanche of Castile was a woman remarkable for
her personal beauty and queenly bearing. She knew
how to unite dignity of mien and elegance of estate
with that suavity which wins the hearts of all. According
to a contemporary, Matthew Paris, she was
“the most discreet woman of her time, with a mind
singularly quick and penetrating, and with a man’s
heart to leaven her woman’s sex and ideas; personally
magnanimous, of indomitable energy, sovereign
mistress in all the affairs of her age, worthy to be
compared with Semiramis, the most eminent of her
sex.” The only weakness remembered of Queen
Blanche was one which might be attributed to the
intensity of her maternal affection. She was rudely
jealous of Marguerite when the latter became wife of
her son Louis, and resented the least absorption of
her son’s attention and love. She was possessed
of decided ability for government, and at the death
of her husband, Louis <abbr title='the eighth'>VIII.</abbr> (1226), assumed the direction
of affairs as the guardian of her son, then a
lad of eleven years.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> is described as very handsome, his features
of almost feminine delicacy, his hair light, long,
and flowing. He was extremely courteous, gentle, and
companionable. One might have suspected weakness
from the softness of his manners, until it was
observed that he maintained the same quiet demeanor
while shrewdly watching the chicanery of the court
and while planning the most warlike and desperate
expeditions against his foes. When La Marche rebelled
and insulted his Majesty, Louis made no retort,
but deliberated regarding him with his counsellors
without apparent resentment, and laid plans so shrewd
and far-reaching that they conquered both the rebel’s
arms and hatred. The kings of France had always
been at variance, often at swords’ points, with the
great feudal barons of the realm; but in 1243 Louis
made such arrangement with them as won their complete
fidelity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The moral qualities of Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr>, as well as his repute
for sound judgment, led to his selection by foreigners
to arbitrate their disputes, as when Henry
<abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> of England and his barons submitted their differences
to the French king’s opinion. He was by
impulse and principle a philanthropist, loving the
people of all conditions. The sick domestics of the
palace were often nursed by the royal hand. Wherever
he went his servants were ordered to distribute
sufficient money to provide for the needs of one hundred
poor persons, that the people might not feel the
shadow of royalty without its sunshine. The chroniclers
delight in picturing the monarch under the
broad tree, listening to the complaints of a crowd of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>his humblest subjects. That justice and mercy
might extend beyond his personal supervision, he
appointed “restitution offices,” where the best of
men granted rehearing of any case in which a worsted
litigant deemed himself injured by the letter of the
law. This, perhaps, is the first institution in the
spirit of our modern courts of equity. During an
illness, in which he thought he might die, he summoned
his son Louis and said, “Fair son, I pray thee
make thyself beloved of the people of thy kingdom,
for verily I would rather a Scot should come and
govern our people well and loyally than have thee
govern them ill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The piety of Louis shone in his care of religious
houses and in the establishment of hospitals, especially
for leprosy, a disease which was brought into Europe
by pilgrims returning from the East. Churches were
multiplied and ornamented, for, said the monarch,
“the most sure means to avoid perishing like the impious
is to love and enrich the place in which dwells
the glory of the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not to the discredit of the personal character
of Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> that he was not entirely free from the
bigotry and superstition of his age. He treated
heresy as of the nature of rebellion, and did not stay
the heavy hand of persecution in some instances.
He especially revered relics. When a nail, which
was believed to have been one of those that pierced
the hands of Jesus, was temporarily missing from its
casket, he cried, “I would rather that the best city
in my kingdom had been swallowed up in the earth.”
With joy he paid a large price to Baldwin <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Latin King of Constantinople, for our Saviour’s
crown of thorns. The “Holy Chapel,” which he
built to shield the precious relics, still remains one of
the finest monuments of mediæval times. In private
life Louis would have preferred the daily routine of
a monk to the diversions of the court. He prided
himself on the hard haircloth worn next his skin as a
token of perpetual humility more than he cared for
his royal robe. At his waist hung, instead of silken
tassels, a scourge of iron chains, which drew blood
from his back once a week. He never laughed on a
Friday. Except where the dignity of his throne required
public defence, Louis scarcely maintained his
royal self-respect, so meek did he try to be. A
common woman once brazenly said to him, “You
are unfit for a king of France, fit only to be a king
of monks and priests.” Louis humbly replied, “You
say the truth,” and with a smile gave her a handful
of money.</p>

<p class='c007'>As early as 1239, when Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> was twenty-four
years of age, he manifested great zeal for the crusades,
and sent Amaury de Montfort to fight as his
personal representative on the field. Five years later
(1244) he was afflicted with such serious illness that
at one moment he was believed to be dead. The
watchers were startled by his sepulchral voice: “He,
by God’s grace, hath visited me—He who cometh
from on high hath recalled me from among the
dead.” Reviving from his swoon, he bade the Bishop
of Paris place upon his shoulder the cross of the
voyage over the sea. Three years passed, during
which he seemingly forgot the vow, but an incident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>proved that the holy enthusiasm still burned in his
heart. Allusion being made one day to the cross he
wore as having been assumed at a moment when he
was of wavering mind through bodily weakness, the
king instantly undid the emblem from his shoulder
and gave it to the Bishop of Paris; he then added,
“Now assuredly I am in my senses. He that knoweth
all things knoweth that until that cross is replaced
upon my shoulder no food shall enter my lips.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time Pope Innocent <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr> was attempting to
arouse Europe to a new crusade, but since his greater
zeal was for a crusade against Frederick <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, the holy
war lacked recruits. Germany was in the midst of
the civil dissension which Innocent had stirred up
by acknowledging his subservient tool, Henry, Landgrave
of Hesse, as emperor. Italy was rent with the
contention between Guelph and Ghibelline, fostered
by the same mistaken judgment of Innocent. England
was at war with Scotland and Wales. Frederick
<abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, in order to avert the thickening disasters from
his realm, proposed to personally abdicate the imperial
throne in favor of his son Conrad, and himself
to lead an army to Palestine, with an oath never to
return, if even this personal sacrifice would appease
the papal resentment. Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> besought the Holy
Father to accede to this proposal and to assume a
different attitude towards a Christian monarch, but
Innocent was obdurate to all entreaties. The church
of Christ was ruled by the hatred and wrath of one
who, above all men, should have remembered the
Lord’s prayer, “Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
those who trespass against us.” The penalty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>of breaking the precepts of human wisdom and divine
charity at length fell upon him. The Pope lost the
sympathy of the kingdoms; even the French nobles,
though jealous of Germany, formed a league for
their defence against papal encroachments. This,
if not the origin of, greatly favored the movement
for Gallican liberties, which has continued ever since.</p>

<p class='c007'>Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> took upon himself the duty of leading
the crusade; he convoked a parliament of the dignitaries
of his realm, and by his eloquence moved the
princes and nobles to follow his example. His
queen, Marguerite, with many of her proudest ladies,
assumed the cross. Among the warriors was the
Prince de Joinville, the endeared companion and adviser
of the king, to whose prolific and graceful pen
the world is indebted for the history of Louis’s time
and personal adventures. Those who did not at
once volunteer to join the crusade were variously
persuaded by the zeal of the monarch. It was the
custom for the French kings at certain solemnities to
present their courtiers with mantles, which they put
on in his presence and wore afterwards as the sign
of royal favor. Louis observed the custom on
Christmas eve. As the guests marched from the
shaded robing-room to the lighted chapel they were
amazed to discover the cross of voyage sewed upon
every man’s shoulder. The courtiers laughed at the
joke perpetrated upon them, but, feeling its significance,
yielded to the royal will and honored their
investment by taking the crusaders’ vow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The example of the king affected the entire population.
In every village was seen the procession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>volunteers seeking the blessing of the altar and enrolling
themselves under their lords. Whole territories
were thus stripped of their defenders and even
of the tillers of the soil; rising arts were bereft of
their workmen. France was despoiling itself for the
sake of an idea. Modern utilitarianism may deride
it, but our sentiment applauds where our judgment
condemns. It was indeed still the “age of faith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In June, 1248, Louis took up the pilgrim staff together
with the oriflamme of France. He left the
kingdom to the care of his mother, Blanche, and with
his wife set out upon what proved to be one of the
most romantic and tragic of adventures. At Lyons
he made confession to the Pope, whom he again unavailingly
entreated to be at peace with Frederick.
As the cavalcade was nearing Avignon his men were
assaulted, and begged to be permitted to avenge the
insult by an attack upon that city. “No,” replied
the king; “I go from France not to avenge my own
injuries, but those of my Lord Jesus Christ.” At
Marseilles a similar outrage occurred. The king refused
to retaliate, saying, “God forbid that Satan
should prevail, for he is angered at our expedition
and is seeking to put obstacles in the way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In August he set sail from Aigues-Mortes, a place
he had purchased and in whose harbor he had prepared
his fleet; he here diminished his host by discharging
with abundant recompense all such as he
deemed not of the right sort either in character or
pious purpose. As the French had no experience
in navigation, the movement of the fleet was committed
to Genoese captains. Joinville’s experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>will be appreciated by many landsmen: “A great
fool is he who, having any sin on his soul, places
himself in such danger; for if he goes to sleep at
night he cannot be certain he shall not find himself
at the bottom of the sea in the morning.” Landing
in Cyprus, the expedition was warmly received by
the king of the island, but found scanty supply of
provisions. Louis appealed to the Venetians, who
sent him much corn and wine. Frederick <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, learning
of the crusaders’ need, also sent supplies. Louis
replied with thanks to the emperor, and sent another
appeal to the Pope to forego his wrath upon so generous
a friend to the cause of the Master; but it
evoked no compassion in the relentless heart of the
pontiff.</p>

<p class='c007'>Louis was prevailed upon to spend the winter in
Cyprus, under pledge of the Cypriotes to accompany
him in the spring. Luxury brought relaxation of
discipline and all its accompanying vices. This was
followed by a pest, which caused the death of two
hundred and fifty knights. During the winter there
arrived an embassy of Tartars, who announced the
conversion to Christianity of one of their great
princes, and solicited alliance with the French. Louis
apparently credited the story, and sent to the Tartar
chief a scarlet tent, in the canvas of which were
wrought in silken letters many texts of Scripture,
which it was hoped might assist the convert’s meditation.
The embassage proved to be a ruse—doubtless
an attempt to spy out the destination and power
of the crusaders.</p>

<p class='c007'>A more significant overture was received from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>Masters of the Templars and Hospitallers, who proposed,
rather than war, to open negotiations with the
Sultan of Cairo, who might be disposed to grant more
than the Christians could wrest from him. This Louis
regarded as an insult to his prowess and vow.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been determined to strike the enemy in
Egypt. Of the wisdom of this project few were persuaded.
The Arabian writers speak of it as showing
an imbecile mind. Egypt was at this time governed
by Negmeddin, son of Malek-Kamel, the conqueror
of the Christians in their former attempt at Damietta.
This chieftain had united in his hand all the Moslems
from the Nile to the Euphrates. Aware of the plans
of the coming invaders, he massed a great fleet to
descend the Nile and meet the fleet of the Christians,
and an army of commensurate proportions to guard
the banks.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crusaders sailed from Cyprus with eight hundred
vessels; these carried not only warriors and implements
of battle, but many artisans and vast
material for establishing a colony, which project is
regarded even by those who deprecate the military
assault as showing the wide statesmanship of the
French king. A storm scattered the fleet, driving
many ships against the coast of Syria, and compelling
Louis to return to Cyprus with the loss of half his
armament.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second attempt was more successful, and the
fleet approached the walls of Damietta. Joinville
dilates upon the magnificent spectacle: the sea covered
for miles with the ships, whose topmasts gleamed
with the sign of the cross; the mouth of the Nile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>guarded by the vessels of the Moslem; the shores
lined with the multitude of warriors in various accoutrements,
drawn from all the lands of the Infidel;
the very sky resounding with their pagan cries and
the noise of their trumpets and drums.</p>

<p class='c007'>At break of the next day the French began the
assault. Queen Marguerite’s bark was alone left at
a distance, whence she might watch the fight. The
knights stood, lance in hand, beside their horses on
the broad barges, some of which were propelled by
as many as three hundred rowers. At word of command
the fleet seemed to be lifted by the innumerable
oars and to be fairly hurled upon the shore.
Before they could land the daylight became obscured
with showers of arrows, javelins, and stones, that
poured upon them from the banks. For a moment
the fleet was retarded by the deluge of missiles that
smote the rowers, but the king’s quick command redoubled
their strokes. As the vessels grounded on
the beach he himself led the assault, leaping into the
sea shoulder-deep with sword in hand. The whole
army emulated his heroism, and with the cry, “Montjoie!
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Denis!” plunged into the water. The attack
was as when the sea itself assails the land with
tidal wave. The Moslems were driven back. The
crusaders completed their array on solid ground, but
scarcely were they in battle order before the Moslem
cavalry rode down upon them with the noise and
speed of a sirocco from the neighboring desert. Amid
the terrible mêlée Louis bent his knees a moment on
the sands, anew giving himself to the will of Heaven,
then dashed into the thickest of the fight. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>shore ran with rills of blood, which incarnadined the
sea. Steadily the oriflamme of France mounted the
beach. The war-galleys made an equally furious
assault upon the Moslem navy. With the impetuous
ramming of the tough prows of the French vessels
many a ship filled with Egyptian warriors was sent
to the bottom. The cross gained the mouth of the
river, up which its defenders fled. By nightfall the
coast and both banks of the Nile had been gained,
and under the stars of Egypt the Christian camp resounded
with the Te Deum and shouts of victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The joy of the Christians was soon mingled with
wonder. The horizon to the south of them suddenly
seemed on fire. The scouts, approaching Damietta
in the early dawn, discovered that its walls were like
the crater of some vast volcano pouring up clouds
of smoke shot through with flashes of flame. The
gates of the town were wide open. Entering cautiously,
they found the streets filled with newly
slaughtered multitudes. It would seem that the
panic of the Moslems had left them neither heart
nor wit for the defence of their stronghold. In the
blindness of their rage they had put to death multitudes
of Christians, and the Christians, in the frenzy
of their despair, had slain their Moslem neighbors.
Fakr Eddin, the commandant, had given orders to
fire the houses, mosques, and fortifications, consuming
everything, that the crusaders might not profit
by their victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Christians upon entering the city found little
spoil to tempt their rapacity, and were easily persuaded
to celebrate their conquest with the services
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>of religion. King Louis marched at the head of a
grand procession to the great mosque, which they
solemnly consecrated to the worship of the Virgin
Mary. The Sultan of Cairo had been prevented by
illness from personally taking part in the battle. He
expressed his displeasure at the defeat of his soldiers
by ordering the beheading of fifty-four men of the
garrison of Damietta. But the display of vengeance
upon the helpless could not restore his lost prestige
in the presence of a gigantic enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Queen Marguerite established her court in Damietta.
The army encamped without the walls. All
gave themselves up to enjoyment, as if a single defeat
of the foe had been its annihilation. Instead of
following up the advantage gained, it was determined
to await the gathering of the ships scattered by the
storm, and for the arrival of a French contingent
under the king’s brother, who desired to also share
in the conquest. Inaction produced the usual consequences
in the camp. Vice reigned in the very
proximity of the king’s quarters, which he was as
powerless to prevent as monarchs of that age generally
were to cleanse the slums that crept close to
their palaces. The leaders fell to quarrelling over
the scanty spoil of Damietta, and even disputed its
possession by the sovereign. The soldiers robbed
the traders who came into the camp, and soon prevented
even the supply of comforts from this source.
Foray parties brought in the Egyptian women they
captured, and established harems, which had not
even the screens of Oriental custom. The king’s
authority fell into total disregard.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>There was also strife between the English and
the French. William Longsword, Earl of Salisbury,
excited jealousy by his impetuous and successful
enterprises, in one of which he captured a stronghold
near Alexandria, together with many women belonging
to noble Egyptian families. In another raid he
seized a richly laden caravan. The French disputed
the possession of his booty. The Count d’Artois was
especially envious of the renown of his fellow-warrior,
and seized a portion of the spoil in the name of
Louis. When the king hesitated to order its restoration,
fearing to excite division in his immediate
family, Earl William declared to the royal face, “You
are not then a king, since you are not able to administer
justice.” He left the camp and retired to
Acre. The Count d’Artois added insult by exclaiming,
“Now the army of the noble French is well
purged of these <i>tailed</i> Englishmen”—alluding to a
rumor that, as punishment for the murder of Thomas
à Becket, the people of the British Isles had begun
to develop the caudal appendage in proof that they
were of “their father, the devil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During these dissensions the lines of the encampment
were left without any systematic defence, and
were constantly raided by parties of swift Bedouin
riders, who made their assault as the sudden dust-clouds
of Libya overwhelm the traveller and quickly
disappear again in their kindred sands. Carismian
adventurers were also lured by the sultan’s promise
of a golden bezant for every Christian head, and half
as much for a right hand, and a fifth for a foot.
They dashed upon the detached groups, or stole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>secretly by night into the tents, and bore away their
prize, leaving the mutilated bodies of the knights to
tell of their deed. The sultan, Negmeddin, knowing
that disease was hastening his end, redeemed the time
by the incessant activity of his subalterns. Mansourah,
at the junction of the branches of the Nile, soon
presented the aspect of an impregnable circle of
fortifications.</p>

<p class='c007'>The arrival of the king’s brother, the Count of
Poitiers, revived the martial ardor of the French;
and it was decided to attack the Egyptian capital,
Cairo, or Babylon (Babloon), as it was then called.
The majority of the crusaders supposed this place to
be the Babylon of the Scriptures, still stored with the
immense riches of the ancients, and waiting for them
to fulfil upon it the curses of the prophets. There
was a rumor that certain renegade Moslems had already
entered into a compact to deliver the citadel
of Cairo to the advancing Christians. This report
even reached Europe, where it was magnified into a
detailed account of the capture of the Egyptian capital,
and awakened universal joy, to be turned into
mourning as the news of the real events arrived.</p>

<p class='c007'>Negmeddin, Sultan of Cairo, died, but the event
was kept secret within the citadel, while Chegger-Eddour,
the favorite sultana, issued orders as if her
husband were living, until the new sultan, Almoadam
Turan Shan, had securely gripped the reins of power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the French were advancing. On December
19th they reached the canal Aschmoun, a
deep and broad stream, which could be crossed only
by the crusaders building a causeway. As fast as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>this work extended into the stream the Moslems dug
away the opposite bank, and so each day left the
canal of unlessened width. The Infidels massed
across the canal; their fleet waited in the Nile
above. The Christians were forced to make their
camp at Mansourah, on the identical site of the terrible
disaster thirty years before.</p>

<p class='c007'>But neither the memories of the spot which monumented
the fatal end of the previous crusade, nor the
evidences of danger which they saw on every side,
could subdue the gayety for which the French even
in that age were proverbial. When a knight of rank
was being buried his companions interrupted the
chanting of the mass for the repose of his soul by
their bantering as to which of them was most apt to
win the hand of his widow. Joinville notes the punishment
that followed this irreverence, in that all of
this company perished in the very next battle, and
that not one of their widows respected the memory
of her husband sufficiently to remain long without
marrying one of his better-behaved comrades. On
this old battle-ground the crusaders were incessantly
assailed with missiles and with Greek fire, whose huge
balls, exploding with tremendous detonations, scattered
danger far and wide, and destroyed the wooden
towers and engines of the French as fast as they could
be constructed.</p>

<p class='c007'>A ford was opportunely discovered not far distant;
the French marched by night and prepared to wade
the stream at daybreak. Robert, Count d’Artois, the
king’s brother, begged the honor of crossing first. He
promised to wait on the farther bank until the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>army was with him, but the flight of an opposing
band of Moslems was too much for the hot head of
this youth. In vain did the experienced Masters of
the Templars and Hospitallers protest against the
foolhardiness of pursuing the retreating band into the
very midst of their fortifications and hosts. The
Count d’Artois replied with taunts, impugning the
loyalty and courage of the older warriors: “They
fear that if the country be conquered their domination
will cease.” This was too much for the self-restraint
of the most cautious. “Raise, then, the
banner!” cried the Master of the Templars. William
Longsword still remonstrated. The Count
d’Artois replied, “What cowardice in these long-tailed
English!” To which the Englishman made
equal bravado: “We shall be to-day where you will
not dare to touch my horse’s tail.” With that all
dashed ahead for the desperate assault. The Moslems
could not at first withstand this impetuous
charge. Fakr Eddin was surprised half dressed, and
while endeavoring to rally his troops was slain. On
swept the victors, driving the enemy over the plain
and following them into Mansourah.</p>

<p class='c007'>But a keen-eyed leader had taken the place of the
fallen Fakr Eddin. Bibars Bendoctar, captain of
the Mamelukes, quickly checked the flight, and by
skilful manœuvring surrounded the city of Mansourah
before the Christians could emerge from its gates.
Thus the victors were imprisoned within the walls
they had conquered. The main body of Christians,
delayed in the crossing, at length followed after their
comrades, not knowing of their unhappy fate. Without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>orderly array they spread over the field; a thousand
battles were fought instead of one, as band after
band met the scattered detachments of the enemy.
Before the Christians could plan their engagement
Bibars had collected an orderly force and was upon
them. Riding through their disconnected ranks, he
steadily pressed the slaughter-line back to the canal.
The water was reddened with the blood of the
wounded and soon covered with the bodies of the
drowned. Louis, unable to issue commands that
could be heard, set a splendid example of heroism
by dashing with his squires into the thickest ranks
of the foe. He so far outstripped his quickest attendants
that he soon found himself alone, surrounded
by six stalwart Moslems, who endeavored to capture
him, his royal person being revealed by his gorgeous
uniform. With great strength and skill, which his
countrymen have never ceased to celebrate, he extricated
himself from the danger and, joined by his
guards, led the army in a resistless charge. Their
valor saved that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>But alas for those in Mansourah! For five hours
this valiant but deluded band stood in the streets,
fighting in vain for their lives. Almost the entire
vanguard of fifteen hundred perished. England
mourned William Longsword, whose death, according
to the chronicle, was announced at the very moment
to his mother by a vision of her son, a triumphant
knight, entering heaven. The bravery of
Longsword so impressed his enemies that they carefully
marked his grave and in after years restored
his body to his kinspeople. France lost the royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>brother, Count d’Artois, who, the English say, attempted
to escape by casting himself into the Nile.
The Hospitallers left their Grand Master a prisoner.
The Templars watched long that night before they
beheld their leader returning to their camp covered
with wounds and rags. Joinville, who narrates the
events of that fatal day, consoled his king by showing
him his own five ghastly wounds. The Christians
were victorious if victory is proved solely by
possession of the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three days later Bibars reappeared; his army
stretched from the canal to the river. Another day
of terrible havoc followed. At nightfall the Christians
had maintained their ground, but their losses
were equal to a fresh defeat. The records of nearly
all the great families of France are starred by the
dead who represented them that night as they lay
unburied on the plain of Mansourah.</p>

<p class='c007'>Discretion suggested the retreat of the remnant of
the crusaders to Damietta, but desperation took
counsel only of its battle-heated blood. They determined
to remain and hold the ground so dearly
won. It was an unwise decision. While the human
enemy was unable to resume the attack, a more fearful
one stalked visibly among them. The multitude
of dead bodies which covered the land and water
quickly putrefied and bred pestilence. The picture
of a knight walking days and nights along the canal,
exposed to the fetid death-vapors while he searched
among the corpses for his master, Robert d’Artois,
might be an allegory of France itself as she moaned
and waited for thousands of her sons who would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>never return. Those who survived were attacked
by a virulent disease, which Joinville thus describes:
“The flesh of our legs dried away to the bone, and
our skins became of black or earth color, like an old
saddle which has been a long time laid aside.” The
fish of the Nile had become poisonous from feeding
upon the dead bodies, and putrefied the mouths of
those who ate them. “It became necessary for the
barbers to cut out the swollen flesh of the gums of
all who were afflicted with this disease so that they
could not eat, but went about in the army crying
and moaning.” So decimated were the ranks that
grooms took the places of knights, not waiting for
chivalric ceremonies, and put on the noble armor
they had been accustomed to clean. There were
not enough priests left alive to shrive the dying.
King Louis gave himself up to nursing the sick and
consoling their last hours until he himself was prostrated
by the epidemic. The crusaders watched in
anxiety by his cot what they feared would be the
extinction of their last hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moslems, keeping at a safe distance from this
death-beleaguered camp, added famine to the other
horrors by cutting off supplies. They lay in wait
for vessels laden with provisions from Europe, and
seized them as they were ascending the Nile. At
length almost the entire Christian fleet was captured.
Louis was thus reduced to making proposals to abandon
Egypt on condition of the restoration of Jerusalem
to Christian rule. The sultan agreed, provided
the king himself should be surrendered to him as a
hostage until the last European had left the country.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Louis consented, but the warriors refused to accede
to what they deemed the disgraceful terms of putting
in pawn their king. Nothing remained but an attempt
to return to Damietta.</p>

<p class='c007'>This retreat of the Christians was fraught with
miseries which baffle description. The women, the
children, and the sick were stowed in the few boats
that remained, and in the darkness of night drifted
down the stream. The soldiers took up their perilous
march along the banks. Some of the nobles, together
with the papal legate, having secured a vessel,
urged the king to embark. He refused, being determined,
as he declared, to tramp with the last man
that survived. The camp they were leaving was
quickly assailed by the Moslems, who went through it
slaughtering all they could find. Louis turned back
and fought with the desperation of a tigress protecting
her young. The cry, “Wait for the king!” rang
along the banks, and the vessels stopped; but Louis
forbade any to loiter. At length the rear-guard was
in motion. The king was provided with a horse,
and, without helmet or cuirass, arrayed only with his
sword and surrounded by a handful of braves, brought
up the rear of a mighty funeral procession, in which
the living were moving to their own graves. The
king afterwards spoke of the heroic fidelity of one of
his attendants, Geoffrey de Sargines, “who protected
me against the Saracens as a good servant protects
his lord’s tankard against the flies.” The cortège—it
was such rather than an army—moved along roads
lined with the dead and dying. Horrible cries
startled them on every side. Peering through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>darkness, they saw the forms of comrades often deprived
of hands and feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>As birds of prey follow the traveller in the desert
and sometimes do not wait until he is dead before
they attack his languishing form, so the Moslems
pursued the band which they knew to be foredoomed
to perish, and hastened the end by their murderous
assault. Those who had embarked on boats met
with a disaster equal to that of those who trudged
on land. The enemy’s fleet stopped them near
Mehallah. The Christian boats were huddled together
so that they could not move. The crusaders
could scarcely find foot room on the crowded decks;
the Mussulman archers on the shore poured upon
them a storm of arrows, many of which were tipped
with the Greek fire. The Christians on the ships
were no longer soldiers, but victims of slaughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the land it was the same. The king, weak
unto death, was defended by the little band about
him. They brought him into a house in the town
of Menieh; within doors a tradeswoman from Paris
held the royal head in her lap, as was supposed,
watching him die. Without in the streets brave men
laid down their lives in a last effort to save even their
king’s body, but their heroic devotion served only to
emblazon itself on this darkest page of the history of
the crusades. Louis was taken by the foe and loaded
with chains, but he felt more weightily the shame
of being the first king of France ever a prisoner in
the hands of a foreign enemy. Joinville, who tells
the story, was dragged to a neighboring house, and
would have been slain but that a little child clung to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>him and, by this double appeal of helplessness, excited
the interposition of one whom he calls “the good
Saracen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moslems returned to Mansourah in triumph.
They dressed their fleet in utmost gayety as it bore
the person of their royal captive. Their armies
marched on either bank of the Nile, escorting the
Christian survivors, who were driven along with
their hands bound behind their backs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Queen Marguerite was at Damietta, already entering
the pains of childbed. Ordering all to leave her
chamber but an aged knight, she said to him, “I require
you, on the faith you have pledged to me, that
if the enemy shall take this city you will cut off my
head rather than allow me to become a captive.”
“Certainly, madam, I will do it,” he replied. The
queen gave birth to a son, whom she called Jean
Tristan, because of the sorrows that begirt his birth.
Learning that the remnant of the city guard proposed
abandoning Damietta, she forbade it as involving
additional disgrace. “Be moved by my tears,” she
cried, “and have pity on the poor child whom you
see lying on my bosom.” The attitude of this heroine
saved the city, the last spot of Christian possession
in the land they had come to conquer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Louis languished in prison. He had no clothing
but a coarse cassock, which a fellow-prisoner had
taken from his own person. Even the Moslems who
guarded him afterwards expressed their reverence
for the piety the captive monarch displayed, “worthy
of a saint of Islam, the religion of holy resignation.”
The sultan at length sent him a wardrobe of fifty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>magnificent dresses for himself and his attendants.
Louis declined them, saying that as a French king
he could not wear the raiment of a foreign prince.
They prepared him a feast, but Louis declined to
partake of it, because he was a captive. The services
of the Moslem physicians he did not reject,
knowing that if it was the purpose of his enemies to
keep him alive to grace their triumph, it was his duty
to his throne not to sacrifice any opportunity of
lengthening life by which he might regain it. The
sultan promised him liberty on condition of his issuing
an order for the surrender of Damietta and the
Christian strongholds of Palestine. He replied, “The
Christian cities do not belong to me, but to God.”
The sultan then threatened him with the most frightful
torture, such as was reserved for the lowest criminals.
Louis replied, “I am the sultan’s prisoner; he
can do with me what he pleases.” A Moslem rejoined,
“You treat us, sire, as if you had us in prison
instead of our holding you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>About him in an open court Louis daily looked
upon the miseries of the remnant of his army. They
were naked, clothed only in scars and blood from
their unhealed wounds. Each day a number were
dragged out and offered the alternative of abjuring
their faith and embracing Mohammedanism or being
slain. The dead bodies that were daily cast into the
Nile told the story of their choice. Many were
carried to Cairo to die in its dungeons or were sold
as slaves to surrounding tribes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conquerors finally wearied of their attempt to
subdue the proud spirits of those whose bodies they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>held, and proposed to liberate the king for a million
golden bezants and the surrender of Damietta.
Louis accepted the offer on condition that Queen
Marguerite should approve, adding in the spirit of the
Chivalry of that age, “The queen is my lady; I can
do nothing without her consent.” It was agreed
that Damietta should be the ransom for the king,
while he should pay from his own purse the ransom
money for such of his comrades as survived.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fulfilment of the treaty was interrupted by a
strange turn of affairs. The Sultan Almoadam, inflated
with pride over his victories, had stirred the
jealousy of the Mamelukes. Chegger-Eddour, the
slave-woman who had risen to be the mistress of
Egypt, turned also against the man whom as her
husband she had raised to power. The sultan gave
a banquet to his chief officers; at the end of the feast
Bibars Bendoctar, the leader of the Mamelukes, approached
him and aimed a blow with his dagger,
which, however, inflicted but a slight wound. Almoadam
fled to a tower; the Mamelukes fired the
edifice; their victim threw himself through the smoke
and flames from a window, his bruised body falling
among his foes; Bibars smote him with a sabre.
Bleeding and weak with terror, Almoadam flung
himself into the Nile; the soldiers plunged after him
and held him until dead beneath the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The infuriated Mamelukes then assailed the galley
in which Joinville and several leaders of the Christians
were confined, and bade them prepare for death.
There was but a single priest in the company and no
time for shriving one by one, so they confessed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>one another, Joinville, the layman, giving to Guy
d’Ibelin, as he says, “such absolution as God had
given me power to give.” Fortunately the rage of the
Mamelukes was diverted elsewhere, and the “dead
men came to life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moslems, unable to secure a successor to
Almoadam from among their warriors, gave the
crown to the Sultana Chegger-Eddour, much to the
disgust of the Mohammedan world. After great dissension
and many threats the leaders of the Moslems
proposed to carry out the treaty with the Franks
which the unfortunate Almoadam had agreed to.
They took an oath to observe its conditions and
asked of Louis a similar pledge; this he rejected with
scorn, assuming that the word of a French king
needed no confirmation. The knights and lords of
his party embarked on vessels and descended the
Nile, the king marching with his Moslem guard
along the shore. At Damietta he was joined by
Queen Marguerite and her court.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of its honorable surrender the Moslems
hastened to loot Damietta and put to death every
Christian that remained. This breach of treaty and
their new taste of blood infuriated the mob of Moslems
for further deeds of dishonor and cruelty. The
galleys of the French were ordered to reascend the
Nile. It was proposed to complete the tragedy in one
act by slaughtering all the invaders. The Moslems
were diverted from this outrage only by the consideration,
as expressed in the speech of one of them, that
“the dead pay no ransom,” and that to massacre the
remnant of the French army would be to deprive themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>of the bezants pledged as the price of their lives.
So the miserable exodus of the crusaders was resumed,
not, however, without anticipation that the
fickle temper of their captors might again change.
At the mouth of the Nile a Genoese vessel received
the king; as soon as he was on deck an array of
archers sprang to the bulwarks and dispersed the
Egyptians, and the vessel sped rapidly out to sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Louis put in at Acre, bringing to the meagre force
there but a few more war-wasted men, wider demands
upon its diminished resources, and a pestilent
disease, which slew scores daily. In vain did France
call for her king to return; pride or piety led him to
refuse to desert his unhappy followers. There were
still twelve thousand Frenchmen in the prisons of
Egypt or scattered as slaves over the lands bordering
the Nile. These he must endeavor to rescue. The
Hospitallers, Templars, and Teutonic Knights, together
with the nobles of Palestine, entreated his
presence with them. For several weeks there were
almost daily councils, some, among them the king’s
two surviving brothers, declaring that France, threatened
by England, needed the king, while his presence
almost without following in Palestine could be no
help to the Christian cause, if it did not excite the
everywhere victorious Moslems to greater rapacity.
Others among them, like Prince Joinville, advocated
remaining. Louis listened to the latter. The king’s
brothers, the dukes of Anjou and Poitiers, returned
to France.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moslems of Egypt, grown quickly tired of the
Sultana Chegger-Eddour, made her yield up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>sceptre. She shrewdly passed it to a favorite, Aibek,
by marrying him, and thus retained the substance of
power.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new Sultan of Egypt and the Sultan of Damascus
and Aleppo each invoked the aid of Louis
against the other. Motives of vengeance would have
inclined him to side with the latter, but dread for
the fate of the French still left in Egypt, and regard
for his treaty, hard as its terms had been, prevented
this choice, except in the event of the Egyptians not
speedily fulfilling their part of the contract in liberating
the captives. The threat of such alliance
brought from Egypt some instalments of prisoners.
One band of two hundred knights carried with them
to Acre, as their best contribution to the cause, the
bones of several of their comrades for burial in the
Holy Land. Louis was deeply afflicted by the news
that many of his soldiers refused to return to him,
having renounced the faith of Christ, who no longer
extended to them His succor. Some of these renegades
amassed wealth and rose to power in Egypt,
but never, if we are to believe the Moslem writers,
reached the confidence and respect of the true followers
of the Prophet. This defection is hardly to
be wondered at, since that age refused to believe the
words of Christ, “My kingdom is not of this world,
else would My servants fight.” The Christians partook
too largely of the Moslem idea that religion would
triumph by the sword; but they had not the reserve
faith of the Mohammedans, which led them to take
up the kismet, “It is decreed,” when they were forced
to retreat.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Europe sent an occasional knight to join the forlorn
hope with Louis, but no organized force. The
Pope exhausted his passion in pursuing with malediction
the memory of Frederick <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>, who had just
died. “Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be
glad,” he wrote to the people of Sicily upon the
death of his old enemy. Against the new emperor,
Conrad, he proclaimed a crusade, offering indulgence
to the German mothers and fathers who would induce
their sons to become traitors to their sovereign.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English King, Henry <abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr>, offered to take the
cross for Palestine, but, having raised a large sum of
money for the purpose of an expedition, found other
uses for it. He forbade a large band of his people
embarking for the Holy Land, guarding his ports
against their departure. He even, as Matthew Paris
says, “like a hurt or offended child, who runs to his
mother with his complaints,” obtained a papal mandate
enforcing obedience to his whim in this regard.
Queen Blanche, the regent of France, did indeed
send a ship laden with money to her son, but the
vessel was sunk off the Syrian coast.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief occupation of Louis and his knights was
in repairing the few remaining fortifications held by
the Christians, and in making pious pilgrimages to
the holy places at Nazareth, Tabor, and Cana. The
Sultan of Damascus invited him to Jerusalem, but,
having come to conquer it, he would not consent to
enter it as a guest, having in mind the example of
Richard Cœur de Lion, who sixty years before had
refused to look upon the city he could not rescue.
The Egyptians pressed Louis for alliance against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>Sultan of Damascus. They pledged to liberate all
captives remaining in Egypt, and further to send to
Palestine the heads of the Christians which had been
exposed on the walls of Cairo; they would also give
up Jerusalem and nearly all the cities of Palestine.
Under this immense lure Louis made treaty with the
Egyptians for fifteen years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sultan of Damascus did not let his resentment
cool before he interposed an army between the
Christians and their new allies. He was defeated
February 3, 1251. The Egyptians were unable or
unwilling to fulfil the promise to join Louis’s forces.
At the expiration of a year the Moslems had made
peace with each other and declared war upon Louis
as their common enemy. The Turkomans also made
raid upon Sidon and slaughtered two thousand of the
Christian people. Louis ordered Joinville to retaliate
by assaulting Baneas, or Cæsarea Philippi, where
they took recompense in blood. As they returned
to Sidon they saw the ground covered with putrefying
corpses of their martyred kinsmen. Louis bade
them bury the dead, but no one would touch spade
for the disgusting task. “Come, my friends, let us
bestow a little earth upon the martyrs of Jesus
Christ,” said the king; and springing from his horse,
he took one of the bodies in his hands and gently
laid it beneath the dirt. His example was followed
by his suite.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few months later news came of the death of
Queen Blanche. The pens of the historians, who are
usually concerned only with great affairs of state and
the issue of battles, linger over the page in which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>describe the tender lamentation of the good Louis.
For two days he spoke to no one; then sent for
Joinville, to whom he outpoured his passionate grief.</p>

<p class='c007'>The call for Louis’s return to France was renewed;
the throne had no protector; England was threatening.
There was no possibility of further service in
the East, yet the king was undecided. Religious
processions of prayer were organized and the altars in
various holy places besieged with petitions for the
divine guidance of the royal mind. At length
Heaven seemed to concur in what had long been the
judgment of men, and the king consented to abandon
the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourteen vessels were sufficient to convey his
forces. Each was fitted with an altar for hourly
service during the voyage. They raised anchor in
the port of Sidon, April 24, 1254. Off Cyprus the
king’s ships were nearly wrecked, but the courage of
the sailors was revived by his words, if the sea did
not subside at his prayer, as some say it did. A
frightful tempest seems to have felt the spell of
Queen Marguerite’s vow of a silver ship to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Nicholas
of Lorraine. After two months and a half (July
8th) the fleet reached Hyères. The king at first refused
to land, as this place was not yet a French
possession; but he was persuaded to yield his patriotic
prejudice on account of his disgust for the water.
His piety also triumphed over his worldly chagrin,
for, “See,” said he, “if God has not proved to us
how vast is His power, when by means of a single
one of the four winds the King of France, the queen,
their children, and so many other persons have escaped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>drowning.” After a journey of two months
more, not a long one for the best mounted in that
age, the royal party reached Paris, September 7,
1254. The king at once repaired to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Denis to
recognize the protection of his patron saint. Then,
with universal welcome, he entered his capital. The
popular enthusiasm was not altogether of joy as the
people contrasted the little band of lords and knights
returning to their wasted estates with the splendid
retinue that six years before had gone forth to conquer
a new empire for France and Christ. But one
thing comforted them as they contemplated the disaster—the
piety of their monarch. This was the
more marked as the age had lost much of its religious
zest. This crusade was very unlike the first
in that it was sustained by the new spirit of Chivalry
rather than of mere sanctity. Cross-wearing was no
longer thought to be necessarily the emblazoning of
Heaven. The haughtiness, the worldliness, not to
say the wickedness, of the popes, who should have
been its spiritual leaders, but who were engrossed in
the gratification of their own jealousies, almost lost
the church the respect of the nations. The beauty
of Louis’s devotion, its unselfishness and spirituality,
somewhat redeemed the character of the movement
upon which Christ Himself seemed to frown through
His adverse providence.</p>
<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE EIGHTH CRUSADE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='chap44' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='forty-four'>XLIV.</abbr> <br> DEATH OF <abbr title='Saint'>ST.</abbr> LOUIS—FALL OF ACRE.</h3>
<p class='c006'>For sixteen years the crusading impulse
seemed dead, under the general belief in
the hopelessness of further efforts. The
songs of the Troubadours even were
turned to lamentations, and were burdened
with the refrain that Christ had fallen asleep and no
longer regarded His people. In the meanwhile there
was rising in the East the new power of the Mamelukes,
which was destined to accomplish the fears of
Christendom.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be recalled that Chegger-Eddour, the slave
Sultana of Egypt, had continued her power by
marrying Aibek, the Mameluke, and thus installing
him as Sultan of Cairo. Whatever Aibek’s ability
to rule men, he utterly failed to master a woman’s
heart. Learning that he whom she had created her
lord was proposing additional matrimonial alliance
with a princess of Mosul, Chegger-Eddour stabbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>him to death. While his dead body was lying at
her feet she sent for the emir Saif Eddin, and offered
him her hand and kingdom. Horrified at the bloody
throne he was invited to sit upon, Saif fled away.
Chegger-Eddour, with versatile affection, the same
day lured two other emirs to look upon her bloody
charms, but, as even a bird will flee the fascination
of a serpent when once it sees its mate disappear in
the devouring jaws, the emirs did not wait for the
embrace of the beautiful enchantress. That night
Chegger-Eddour’s body, red with her own blood,
was tossed into the castle ditch, and the son of Aibek,
a lad of fifteen years, came to the throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the news of the progress of the Tartars, who
had already overthrown the caliphate of Bagdad and
were marching through Syria upon Egypt, led the
Mamelukes to put the reins into stronger hands.
They chose for their leader Koutouz, renowned for
ability and success on many a field. Koutouz met
the advancing Tartars and utterly defeated them in
a great battle on the plain of Tiberas. The Christians,
having endeavored to make alliance with the
Tartars as against the Egyptians, roused the Moslem
spirit of retaliation. Koutouz for a while restrained
his people in the name of Moslem fidelity to vows,
since the treaty with the Christians was still in effect.
Bibars, the victorious leader against Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> in the
affair of Mansourah, opposed the policy of Koutouz.
Meeting him while hunting, he slew the sultan and
claimed the throne on the ground of having thus
made room for himself. Such was the reverence for
brute power that the assassin’s stroke was recognized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>as the indication of the will of Allah. The preparations
which had been made at Cairo for the triumphal
return of Koutouz, the conqueror of the Tartars, were
utilized for the coronation of Bibars as his successor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The elevation of Bibars was an omen of woe for
the Christian cause. Pope Alexander <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr> confessed
that it would now be impossible for any Christian
power to maintain itself in the Holy Land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bibars inaugurated his reign over the Moslems by
ravaging Palestine, destroying Nazareth, Cæsarea,
Arsuf, and Safed, murdering the inhabitants, and
dividing the land among his emirs. Returning to
Egypt, he recuperated his army and made an incursion
into Armenia, taking Jaffa and Antioch on his
way (1268). So many were his captives that the
Arabian chronicler says, “There was not a slave of
a slave that did not possess a slave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But one heart in Europe seemed still to throb with
either faith or courage. The pious Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> was
worn with cares, harassed with the memory of his
previous disaster, and depressed by a wasting disease.
One day he entered his parliament hall in the
Louvre, carrying the “crown of thorns.” In presence
of the princes and nobles he resumed the cross;
for three years he incessantly labored amassing means
and men. The despair of Europe, having exhausted
its doleful sentiment, at the call of the saintly king
changed to hope. The king’s sons, the English
princes, Edward and Edmund, the earls of Pembroke
and Warwick, John Baliol, with many nobles of Scotland,
the kings of Castile, Aragon, and Portugal,
emulated the piety of Louis. The zeal of most of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>these, however, evaporated in the long delay or
under the influence of the dangers that threatened
them at home in the distracted condition of their
lands.</p>

<p class='c007'>In March, 1270, Louis repaired to Notre Dame,
barefooted, with scrip and staff, and placed his kingdom
under care of the patron saint of France. He
then traversed the land to the former port of departure,
Aigues-Mortes, and on July 4, 1270, embarked
upon the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tunis, on the North African coast, was the rendezvous
of innumerable Moslem pirates, whose swift
ships and desperate crews menaced all the passable
water between France and the Holy Land. The
city itself was regarded as an inestimable prize, stored
as it was with the riches of commerce and plunder.
But most priceless, in the thought of Louis, was its
king, of whom it was rumored that he inclined to the
Christian faith. Louis declared that he would willingly
die in a dungeon if by any means he might be
the hand of Providence leading so noble a convert to
the foot of the cross.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was decided to make a descent upon the African
coast. A landing was easily effected. The
Tunisians, not daring to make attack, endeavored to
lure the invaders inward. All hopes of the conversion
of their king disappeared when the dusky monarch
sent a salutation in which he promised to come
with a hundred thousand warriors and receive his
baptism in the blood of battle, a prelibation of which
would be in the slaughter of every Christian in his
dominions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>Meanwhile all North Africa, even to the Nile, was
moving westward under the inspiration of Bibars and
the faith of the Prophet. Nature, too, seemed to be
allied with the Moslems. The fiery sirocco loaded
the atmosphere. The enemy increased the torment
by tossing the hot sands into the air near the Christian
camps. The winds drove these fiery particles
upon them, burying them as under the cinders from
a volcano. Dysentery and the African plague soon
added their horrors. The camp was reduced to the
condition of a battle-field after slaughter. Men died
faster than they could be buried, and fed the plague
with their carcasses. The flower of the French army
withered away. Tristan, the king’s son, he that was
born amid the sorrows of Damietta, fell a victim, in
spite of his father’s prayers and loving ministrations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Louis himself was stricken. They reared the cross
in front of his tent, that from its mystery of love and
grace he might gather strength still to live or to die.
Calling before him his eldest surviving son, Philip, he
instructed him how to govern the kingdom that might
soon be his. He bade him maintain the dignity and
franchises of the throne, with justice to every class,
to avoid warring upon Christian nations, and, above
all, show himself the friend of the poor, the consoler
of the suffering, and the avenger of the injured of
whatever degree. He then turned to his daughter,
the Queen of Navarre, with counsel befitting her station.
Though realizing that his end was near, he
did not refuse to listen to an embassage from the
Greek emperor. Many hours he then spent in prayer.
His mind at length began to waver; in his delirium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>he cried out, “Jerusalem! Jerusalem! We will go to
Jerusalem!” Recovering a little, he bade his attendants
place him upon a bed of ashes, the place of a
penitent sinner; lying here, he cried, “O Lord, I
shall enter into Thy house and shall worship Thee in
Thy tabernacle.” Then, while uttering the words,
“Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit,” he
fell asleep. The beauty and calm of his features
grew deeper until, immobile in death, they seemed
to salute the passing world with a benediction from
the heavenly (August 25, 1270).</p>

<p class='c007'>With the breath of Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> the crusading enterprise
of Europe may be said to have finally expired.
The movements that followed, whatever valor may
have been displayed in them, were as the waves that
continue to dash themselves to pieces on the rocky
shore after the tempest that stirred them has died
down.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few weeks after Louis’s death Prince Edward
of England (afterwards King Edward <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr>) arrived at
Tunis with a brave troop of his young countrymen.
The African coast offering no field for adventures,
he went the following spring (1271) to Acre. After
various raids upon the neighboring country, and
narrowly escaping death by the poisoned dagger of
an assassin, he made a ten years’ truce with the Moslems
and returned home.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the termination of this treaty the Christian
strongholds fell one by one to the Moslems, and the
dislodged inhabitants took final and fatal refuge in
Acre. Here were gathered the heterogeneous remnants
of Christian populations, together with as diverse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>bands from all parts of the world, who for
greed or piety had taken the sword of the waning
cause. The city was rent with dissensions, the various
parties contending as a pack of dogs for the last
bone. Even the Templars and Hospitallers fought
in the streets for such shadows of military honor as
might be left in the general disgrace. Thus for
twenty years Acre remained a monument of the
mercy or indifference of the Moslems.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1291 Pope Nicholas <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr> sent a band of seventeen
hundred mercenaries to protect the place.
These men, failing to receive the pay promised
them, looted the stores of Saracen merchants. The
Sultan Khalil, second successor of Bibars, demanded
redress; it was refused. Khalil marched his troops
beneath the walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The capture of the place was inevitable. The certain
destruction that awaited them affected the inhabitants
as once the people of Jerusalem, who cried,
“Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.” The
revelry of the self-abandoned multitude ceased only
in their ruin. The assault of the foe was quickly rewarded.
Just a century after its recovery from the
Moslems through the valor of Richard Cœur de Lion,
Acre fell back again to their possession. Sixty thousand
Christians were borne away to slavery or put to
death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus faded from the land of the Christ the last ray
of hope of its occupation by His people, until it shall
be conquered by the weapon which He appointed—“the
sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.”</p>

<h3 id='chap45' class='c015'>CHAPTER <abbr title='forty-five'>XLV.</abbr> <br> KINGSHIP—UNITY OF EUROPE—THE PAPACY—LIBERAL THOUGHT—INCREASED KNOWLEDGE—ARTS—LITERATURE—COMMERCE—THE TURKISH POWER.</h3>
<p class='c006'>The picture of Europe at the inauguration
of the crusades in the eleventh century,
with which our volume opened, is very
different from that in which we would
portray the thirteenth century, when the
militant faith had practically ceased its conflict for
the possession of the Holy Land. In government,
in popular morals, in education, in industrial methods,
and in reasonable piety the world had greatly advanced;
but as it was difficult to definitely trace
the causes of the crusades in the earlier era, so it
would be unwise to attribute to their influence all
the changes that had taken place during their continuance.
When a broad river debouches into a
fertile valley it is natural to point to that irrigating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>current as the cause of the abundant vegetation; yet
much of the new life and beauty may be due to other
springs on the hillsides and to better conditions of
soil and climate. There were certainly at work in
society other forces than those which either illustrated
or resulted from the military movements. The great
law of social evolution wrought steadily, sometimes
using, and often in ways aside from, the crusading
projects. The spirit of humanity—or, we may more
wisely say, the Spirit of God in humanity—is a self-developing
power, which must not be overlooked by
the student of history.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already observed the influence of the
crusades upon the growth of kingship, especially in
France. The French people supplied the majority
of the warriors, and their sovereigns were the foremost
in leading and supporting the great endeavor.
Quite naturally leadership in the field compacted the
power of the French throne. The lords who followed
the king abroad were less disposed to dispute his
authority at home. When the crusades began, as
we have seen, the sway of the king was limited to
the neighborhood of Paris. During the reign of
Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr>, which witnessed their close, there were
ceded to the crown by their feudal lords the section
of Toulouse between the Rhone, the sea, and the
Pyrenees, Chartres, Blois, Sancerre, Mâcon, Perche,
Arles, Forcalquier, Foix, and Cahors, while at the
same time England relinquished its claim to Normandy,
Anjou, Maine, Touraine, Poitou, and northern
Saintonge, thus presenting to the eye almost the
present map of France. The various feudal courts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>where they still held separate jurisdiction, yielded
the right of final appeal to the king before the enforcement
of their decisions. Anciently the barons
and clergy of France had been accustomed to meet
in general assembly for the support of the monarchy.
For over a century preceding the first crusade such
assemblies had not been held, but when Louis <abbr title='the seventh'>VII.</abbr>
embarked upon the second crusade the great men of
all sections resumed these loyal conventions. It
may therefore be said that modern France was born
amid the throes of the mediæval holy wars. In
Germany the case was different. The incessant
quarrel of Pope and emperor, to which the various
crusading projects gave fuel, weakened imperialism
in central and southern Europe. The English
throne doubtless profited by the part taken by the
people in the foreign adventures, which diverted
the ambition of the most restless, who would otherwise
have more seriously assailed the sovereign authority.
Spain was still occupied largely by the
Moors, and was thus prevented from sharing to any
great extent in the Eastern wars upon the Infidels;
but the engagement of so much of the Moslem
energy in defending its distant lands allowed the
Spaniards to slowly accrete their strength for the final
expulsion of the Moors and the establishment of an
undivided Spanish government, two centuries later,
under Ferdinand and Isabella.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another effect of the crusades was the birth of a
distinctly European sentiment. Men, however diverse
in blood and country, could not live for a generation
among common dangers, and be daily actuated by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>common purposes, without realizing brotherhood.
The Celt, the Frank, the Italian, and the Teuton saw
that they were more alike than diverse when facing
the Asiatic. The followers of barons from either side
the Rhine or the opposite slopes of the Apennines
dropped their peculiar war-cries and adopted the
universal “Deus vult!” In time the Frankish language,
the speech of the greater number of the
crusaders, came to be the universal medium of commercial,
military, and diplomatic intercourse. It no
longer belonged exclusively to the subjects of a
French king, but was in a measure continental. The
title “Frank” meant anybody from the lands north
of the Mediterranean and west of the Greek provinces.
The various nations of Europe came to feel less jealousy
of the dominant race than fear of the hostile
civilization whose armies were massed along the
eastern boundaries of the Continent. Thus the project
of Hildebrand to unite Christendom by means
of a crusade was successful in a way he did not contemplate—the
gathering of European peoples into a
secular as well as an ecclesiastical unity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The papal power, however, was that chiefly affected
by the crusades, both to its advantage and its
disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great wealth came to the Papacy from the many
estates which departing crusaders left in either its
possession or trusteeship. Thus Godfrey of Bouillon
alienated large parts of his ancestral holdings by
direct gift to the ecclesiastics. Many returning home
from Palestine, broken in health and spirit by their
trials, insanely depressed with the “vanity of life,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>ended their days in monasteries, which they endowed
with the remnant of their estates. The Pope, having
acquired charge of and responsibility for the crusading
venture, affixed a tax upon the secular clergy and
religious houses. This was at first spent legitimately
in maintaining the enterprises afield, but the immense
revenues were gradually diverted to the general uses
of the church. In the year 1115 the great Countess
Matilda deeded all her domain to the Pope. This
addition to the landed wealth of the Papacy amounted
to perhaps one quarter of Italy, and constituted the
bulk of the modern temporal possessions of the holy
see. To its own local property the Papacy had also
added acquisitions in all countries, until it held
throughout Europe a large part, if not the greater
proportion, of the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>The political influence of the Pope was at the same
time greatly extended by the appointment of papal
legates. Heretofore the Holy Father had on occasion
delegated representatives, who in his name
should investigate causes and settle disputes at a
distance from Rome. During the crusades this legatine
authority was systematized by the organization
of a definite body of men. The Pope was thus impersonated
at every court and in every emergency.
A controversy in London or Jerusalem was settled
by one who on the spot spoke as the Vicegerent of
God. If at times the mistakes of legates imperilled
faith in the papal infallibility, as a rule they kept the
world in awe by the terror of the imagined ubiquity
of the divine presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another great advantage accruing to Rome from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>the crusades was in the establishment of a closer bond
between the church and the individual. Urban <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>
had absolved all crusaders from accountability to
their secular lords during their absence at the seat of
war. In the enthusiasm of the moment the lords had
acquiesced in this as a temporary arrangement; but
they soon lamented their unwisdom in this concession.
The spirit of ecclesiastical obedience was sedulously
cultivated by priest and legate, who pledged temporal
and eternal blessings to those who, whatever
their attitude to their former masters, were now
faithful to the Pope. Loyalty to the secular lord was
never restored as of old. In the common thought
the pontiff was the great king and the real commandant
of armies. Providence was not more omnipresent
than the care of the Holy Father, and the judgment-seat
of heaven was seemingly transferred to every camp
and every home that was accessible to a Roman agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crusades against the Eastern Infidels inspired
audacity and presumption in the church, which suggested
crusades elsewhere. Whoever was not Catholic
was regarded as the Christians’ prey. Preachers
authorized by Rome stirred up the faithful in Saxony
and Denmark to convert by the sword the pagans
living along the shores of the Baltic. An army of
one hundred and fifty thousand, wearing upon their
breasts a red cross on the background of a circle,
symbolizing the universality of Christ’s kingdom,
devastated pagan cities and burned idolatrous temples,
and after three years secured from the leaders a
promise to make their people Christian—a task more
difficult than it had been before, since the half-savage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>people had now learned that Christianity could be
as cruel as their own paganism. Indeed, everything
that was not consecrated to Roman Christianity became
the lawful spoil of whoever, wearing the cross
upon his breast, dared to take it. The crusading zeal
became thus a habit of the Christian mind, and led
to the horrors of the Inquisition in later days.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Rome thus profited in many ways by the
crusades, it must also be noted that the Papacy failed
to maintain to the end the prestige it had acquired
in the earlier period of the movement. Pope Innocent
<abbr title='the third'>III.</abbr> (1198-1216) carried the Hildebrandian
policy to its highest realization. The emperor was
forced to accept his crown from the hands of the
Holy Father, and also to demit the right he had long
contended for of electing the papal incumbent. The
entire episcopacy in Europe was in the Pope’s control
and wrought his will, even in England. But with
Gregory <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> (1227-41) the pile of papal autocracy
began to totter. This Pope, notwithstanding he
had twice excommunicated the emperor, was ultimately
obliged to yield to the secular will. His
unchristian hauteur, and the rancor with which his
successor, Innocent <abbr title='the fourth'>IV.</abbr>, pursued the emperor, lost
the papal chair much of the respect of the Catholic
world. Soon the various governments came to resent
the absolutism of the throne on the Tiber. In 1253
Robert Grosseteste protested against the papal exactions
in England, notwithstanding the king was utterly
subservient to Rome, and thus he merited the title,
which history has given him, of one of the great
fathers of English liberty. Twenty-six years later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>(1279) England enacted the Statute of Mortmain,
which forbade the alienation of property to religious
bodies without the consent of the secular authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>A similar sentiment was working in France. Probably
what is known as the Pragmatic Sanction of
Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> (1268) is not genuine, but the revolt of
that royal saint against the assessments of Rome
without consent of the throne is undoubted, and
Louis may be said to have revived the ancient Gallican
liberties, which for a century and a half had
apparently been dead. A bull of Boniface <abbr title='the eighth'>VIII.</abbr> in
1298 caused open rupture between France and
Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>With Boniface the Papacy was utterly humiliated.
In 1309, within eighteen years of the fall of Acre
into the hands of the Moslems, the popes were in
exile at Avignon, and the government of the church
became the foot-ball of secular ambition. Clement
<abbr title='the fifth'>V.</abbr> (1305-12) ascended the papal throne as the
creature of Philip the Fair of France, and was forced
to lend himself to that monarch’s cruel and unjust
persecution of the Templars, which order was abolished
and its Grand Master burned at the stake in
1312.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the diminished prestige of the Papacy came
the renaissance of freer thought throughout the
world. The failure of the crusades to conquer the
Moslem, and the futile experiments of war upon
heretical sects like the Waldenses and Albigenses,
led to a partial suppression of the epidemic for forceful
conversions, and to a healthful recollection of our
Saviour’s command to Peter, “Put up thy sword.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>In this better condition of the human mind germinated
the modern evangelical methods, the first-fruit
of which was to appear in the Protestant Reformation.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was something in the life of the crusaders that
was favorable to the growth of a new political sentiment,
a popular, not to say a democratic, impulse,
which directly conduced to our modern civil liberties.
In their long and adventurous marches, in the common
camp and fighting together within or beneath the same
fortresses, the lord and his retainers came close to
one another. The common man saw that his muscles
were as strong, his mind as astute, his character
as good, as that of his crested superior. Manhood
rediscovered itself on those Eastern plains. The returned
knight could no longer disdain intercourse with
the brave men whose hamlet nestled beneath his
castle walls. Their common courage, the many scenes
with which both classes were familiar, the dangers
they had shared, were repeated in story and song
about the castle gate. Aristocratic presumption more
than once evoked insurrection among the brawny
fellows, who sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We, too, are men;</div>
      <div class='line'>As great hearts have we,</div>
      <div class='line'>And our strength as theirs.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In their home forays there were to be seen, together
with the ensigns of the feudal lords, the popular banners
of the parishes. Indeed, the new power of the
people came to be the reliance of the king in his
contest with rebel lords. Thus everywhere were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>silently germinated the forces of the commune and
of the Third Estate in France, whose first assembly
was held in 1302. In 1215 England secured for
itself Magna Charta, the central regulation of which
was that no freeman should “be taken, imprisoned,
or damaged in person or estate but by the judgment
of his peers” and “by laws of the land,” a grant to
liberty which stood in spite of the fact that the Pope
declared it to be null and void. In 1265 there came
together the first regular Parliament of England with
the House of Commons a constituent branch.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the crusades we must attribute much of the
increased knowledge of men and the quickening of
inquiry into every department of human welfare.
The crusaders mingled with their enemies in the lull
of active warfare, and especially became familiar with
the arts and customs of the Greeks, their pseudo-allies.
The immense treasures of art secured by the
capture of Constantinople, and displayed in every
centre of Western population, inspired æsthetic taste.
Such buildings appeared as the Palazzo Vecchio,
Santa Croce, and the Duomo at Florence (about
1290), Westminster Abbey and Salisbury Cathedral
(1220) and Cologne Cathedral (1248). Pisano (died
1270) revived sculpture; Cimabue (1240-1300) was
the first of modern painters; the new impulse to
scientific study produced Roger Bacon (1214-92).
The Troubadours enlarged the romance of the lady’s
chamber to that of the field of exploit, where Europe
strove with Asia, and were followed by the great poets
Dante (1265-1321) and Petrarch (1304-74). Splendid
seats of learning sprang up, like the universities of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>Oxford (revived in 1200), Paris (1206), Padua (1222),
and Cambridge (1229). The march of the soldier
prompted the voyage of the peaceful traveller, like
Marco Polo, who in 1272 explored the world as far as
eastern China. The crusader learned something of
the science of government from the Moslem, especially
in matters relating to municipalities, for he was
compelled to note that Cairo and Damascus were
better governed than Paris and London. The wars
suggested improvements in military equipment and
manœuvre; indeed, the art of handling immense
multitudes of men as a single body was learned by
the knights, who, fighting in independent groups,
were often overwhelmed by the massed forces of
their enemies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Commerce during this time began to spread its
white wings upon all seas. For two hundred years
an almost incessant line of vessels passed to and fro
between the ports of the eastern and western Mediterranean,
conveying supplies to the soldiers. As
we have seen, an English fleet transported the army
of Richard <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr> along the Atlantic coast. Men learned
how to lade ships with utmost economy of space and
to take advantage of all winds in sailing them. Roads
were opened which converged to the point of departure
from the surrounding country, where the produce
was gathered for shipment. Agents were scattered
throughout Europe to purchase the needed articles
in small quantities, and prepare them in bulk for the
voyage. War thus fostered the commercial habit
and skill which were utilized in times of peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between 1255 and 1262 the Hanseatic League or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>Trade Guild of the Baltic maritime cities was formed,
and within a century it numbered in its membership
a hundred ports and inland towns. The league
organized merchants for common defence against
pirates, the settlement of disputes by arbitration,
and the acquisition of commercial favors in distant
parts of the world. Maritime laws were codified
during the thirteenth century, under the title of “Il
Consolato del Mare,” and were generally enforced
along the Mediterranean. According to a tradition,
the code called “The Laws of Oleron” was compiled
by Richard <abbr title='the first'>I.</abbr> during his expedition to Palestine, but
with more probability it may be ascribed to the reign
of Louis <abbr title='the ninth'>IX.</abbr> of France. Bills of exchange were in
vogue as early as 1255.</p>

<p class='c007'>Commerce brought wealth in place of the sordid
poverty which had marked castle and cottage in the
eleventh century. Trade introduced new articles of
food and adornment, at first to gratify the palate
and eye of the rich, but soon to elevate the scale of
living everywhere. Such is the power of habit that
luxuries easily acquired quickly become necessities.
People learned no longer to look upon “man’s life
as cheap as beast’s.” Industries sprang up for the
home manufacture of what had originally been
brought from abroad. Invention was stimulated,
and the domestic arts took their place in the foremost
line of the new civilization. The Dark Ages
had given way, and at least the gray light of the
dawn of a better era illumined the horizon.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may note in conclusion the influence of the
crusades in staying the progress of that gigantic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>power which for two centuries had contested with
Christendom the possession of western Asia. So
rapid had been the rise and spread of the new Mohammedan
tide of Turkish invasion that, but for the
barrier presented by the crusaders, it would have
quickly submerged the Balkan peninsula, as it had
already done the plains of Asia Minor; and possibly
it would have poured its desolation into central Europe
at a time when Europe was not prepared to
resist, as it did four hundred years later when the
Turks besieged Vienna. The appeal of the Greek
emperors for the help of their Western Christian
brethren in the eleventh century was warranted by
the seriousness of the menace. The empire was then
too demoralized to withstand alone the onset of these
daring hordes, who possessed superior powers of
physical endurance, great mental activity quickened
by the enterprises they planned for their swords,
and courage as yet undaunted by defeat. What
they might have speedily accomplished but for their
enforced halt of two hundred years on the eastern
shores of the Marmora is suggested by what they
did almost immediately after the crusaders withdrew
their wall of swords. The same decade that witnessed
the fall of Acre saw the founding of the present
dynasty of Ottoman Turks in Nicomedia (1299).
In 1355 they crossed the sea and planted their first
European stronghold at Gallipoli. In the next century
(1452) Mohammed <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr> was enthroned as sultan
in Constantinople, where his successors have for four
hundred years repelled the arms, and still baffle the
diplomacy, of Europe.</p>
